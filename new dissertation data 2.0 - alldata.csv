1,The Independent,Broadsheet,2019,Eco campaigners plan mass civil disobedience to demand ministers lead vegan drive; Animal Rebellion members will use disruption to urge government to fight climate crisis by supporting switch away from meat and dairy production,"A new group calling for the government to spearhead a shift to vegan diets is preparing a campaign of mass civil disobedience.

The group, Animal Rebellion, is joining forces with Extinction Rebellion to stage sit-ins and block roads in London for two weeks in October.

Members say that as well as supporting Extinction Rebellion's demands, they want ministers to end subsidies for producing meat and dairy, and to encourage farmers to switch to growing crops to drastically cut the UK's emissions of damaging greenhouse gases.

They also want the government to support the public in adopting plant-based diets to help the target of reaching a zero-carbon-producing society.

Animal Rebellion, which has local groups in places including Manchester and Bristol, says it already has thousands of supporters, and expects at least 10,000 volunteers will join its protests beginning on 7 October in London.

Organisers have not yet revealed the exact place but, like Extinction Rebellion, are preparing ""civil disobedience"" and disruption on the streets to draw attention to how production of meat and dairy are ""contributing to the climate emergency"".

They point to advice from the UN and IPCC, as well as research by Harvard University on reducing the world's meat consumption.

UK needs to ramp up sustainable farming, government advisers say

Huge reduction in meat eating 'vital to maintain world food supply'

Europe warned to reduce meat and dairy production by 2050

Meat and dairy companies to surpass oil industry as biggest polluters

Harvard concluded that if the land in Britain currently used to grow feed for livestock was used instead for grains, beans, fruit, nuts and vegetables for humans, it would be the equivalent of saving nine years of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. In addition, the food grown could feed everyone with no need for imports, the study said.

Alex Lockwood, an Animal Rebellion organiser and spokesman, told The Independent

: ""The destructive nature of the animal agriculture and fishing industries are contributing hugely to the climate emergency - they are a leading cause of carbon emissions.""

One estimate puts the industries at 51 per cent of global CO2 emissions annually, but more conservative estimates say they account for 14-20 per cent, Mr Lockwood said.


Much Amazon deforestation - through growing soya for livestock, an ""inefficient use of land"" - and water pollution is also down to meat production, studies have shown.

Animal Rebellion is calling on the government to take initiatives such as working with the Vegan Society on a campaign the society is running called Grow Green.

""This isn't scaremongering by animal activists, this is respected organisations like the UN, the IPCC and the Food, Farming and Countryside Commission of the RSA saying we must switch to plant-based diets,"" Mr Lockwood added.

He said some members, but not all, were prepared to be arrested, and they were ""deeply sorry"" for any inconvenience to the public.

""Like Extinction Rebellion, we are collectively of the view that, given the failure of world leaders to date, disruption is now necessary to get anything like commensurate change. If there was a better, less disruptive way of doing this we would do that instead.""",Left-center Bias,1,536,"Eco campaigners plan mass civil disobedience to demand ministers lead vegan drive; Animal Rebellion members will use disruption to urge government to fight climate crisis by supporting switch away from meat and dairy productionA new group calling for the government to spearhead a shift to vegan diets is preparing a campaign of mass civil disobedience.

2,The Independent,Broadsheet,2019,Every meat-eater on the planet is helping to fuel the Amazon forest fires - here's how; But this can't only be pinned onthe consumer. Governments across the globemust leadthe transition to a plant-based food system,"The world's lungs are on fire. The Amazon ablazedominates front pages. Inaction from Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro is centre stage at this weekend's G7 in Biarritz. Heart-breaking videos of indigenous peoples running from their homes and of animals fleeing for their lives have spread over social media.

According to Brazil's Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas Espaciais, 74,155 fires have been spotted in 2019 so far - an 84 per cent increase from the same period last year. Around one million indigenous people from up to 500 tribes are at risk.

Blame for the increase has been laid at the feet of Bolsonaro, with his support for the clearing of the rainforest by cattle ranchers and logging concerns. Stories are emerging of ranchers organising ""fire days"" to clear land for cattle pasture.

In the UK we look on, desperate to know what we can do. Our anger is directed at the Brazilian government, its support for the cattle ranchers coming above the rights of indigenous peoples and protection of the planet. That's why today activists from Extinction Rebellion and its sister movement   Animal Rebellion have joined indigenous groups outside the Brazilian Embassy in London to make their protests heard.

If it is the Brazilian beef industry causing this devastation, is there another way we can protest? If we stop eating beef, will it make a difference?

Brazil is home to around 200 million cows, and is the largest exporter in the world, supplying one quarter of the global beef market. Cattle ranching and soy cultivation are often linked as soy replaces cattle pasture in a yearly rotation, pushing farmers further into the Amazon.

Agriculture is the driver for around 80 per cent of deforestation worldwide. In the Amazon, around 450,000 square kilometres of deforested land in Brazil is now cattle pasture. That's almost a quarter of the rainforest, which produces 20 per cent of the world's oxygen supply. Comparing today's rainforest to World Bank   data from 1970, over 90 per cent of the cleared land in the Amazon region has been converted to cattle ranching.

So if we want to send the message that we won't let deforestation in the Amazon continue, the answer to the question - should we boycott beef? - is yes. But sadly it's not straightforward for consumers to make those decisions.

According to the British Meat Industry, the UK currently imports around 35 per cent of the beef and veal it consumes. Beef makes up nearly half of all meat imports to the UK. While the main supply comes from Ireland, over the last few years improvements in preservation and transportation methods have seen a rise in products from Brazil.

This year Brazilian beef became a weapon as the UK government threatened Ireland in Brexit negotiations. The minister in charge of no-deal planning, Michael Gove, suggested he would consider introducing non-tariff quotas on Brazilian beef if the Irish did not ""drop the backstop"".

But it's not just the British who are considering increasing Brazilian beef imports. The proposed EU-Mercosur Free Trade Agreement also poses the threat of an influx. As part of this agreement the EU will receive lower tariffs on its exports to South America, notably cars and wine; and in return, Brazil and other South American countries will increase their exports to Europe, with a new 99,000-tonne quota for beef and a new low 7.5 per cent tariff.

And a recent investigation proved that meat farmed on illegal pasture in the Amazon had made its way into tinned meat such as corned beef found on the shelves of five major British supermarkets.

Do veggies and vegans share the blame? With the increase in demand for soy milk, shouldn't they also make changes in their diet? Yes, probably - although the vast majority of soy crop globally, over 70 per cent, is still fed directly to livestock.

In the UK, it's British pork eaters who need to take note as much as vegans; a third of all soy imported into the UK is used to feed livestock, mainly pigs.

Soy is also used to feed British cows - especially dairy. So if you're eating beef, pork, or drinking milk, it's likely to be linked to those flames on your screens.

All in all, this a complicated situation for British consumers. One simple answer, being demanded by Animal Rebellion, is for the UK government to lead the transition to a plant-based food system, with investment in the UK's arable crop production, environmental stewardship, and rewilding.

This will stop the food miles involved in importing Brazilian beef from deforested land, while increasing the UK's food sovereignty in an uncertain future threatened by climate breakdown.

In the meantime it's best to cut the Amazon out of your diet completely, and there are plenty of healthy, and ecologically sound, alternatives to choose from.

4,The Independent,Broadsheet,2019,Animal Rebellion: More than 20 arrested after animal rights activists 'shut down' Billingsgate Fish Market; Protesters attempt to stop traffic entering market at 'vigil' for fish killed by food industry,"More than 20 people have been arrested during an animal rights protest at a   London fish market, police have said.

Animal Rebellion, a group which aims to ""follow in Extinction Rebellion's footsteps"" and which wants to ""end the animal agriculture industry"", has said it was behind the protest, in which demonstrators attempted to stop traffic entering the market.

Video footage showed dozens of demonstrators standing outside Billingsgate Fish Market in Poplar in the early hours of Saturday morning.

A Metropolitan Police spokesperson said 23 arrests had been made at the market, as of 9.30am on Saturday.

The spokesperson added that 22 of those arrests were for ""knowingly failing to comply with a condition imposed under Section 14 of the Public Order Act 1986"", and one for aggravated trespass.

That figure could rise as more arrests are officially recorded, police said.

There have been more than 1,000 arrests in connection with Extinction Rebellion protests across London this week.

Alex Lockwood, an Animal Rebellion spokesperson, claimed 28 people had been arrested as of 7.45am and that one protester locked themselves to the entrance gate of the market.

A photo posted by the group showed a woman being carried away by three police officers, accompanied by the caption: ""Mass arrests at Billingsgate"".

Mr Lockwood claimed about 200 people took part in the demonstration.

""One protester got inside [the market] and locked himself to the entrance gate,"" he said. ""It meant they had to shut down the site and police then moved in.""

He added: ""We then sat down, which was obstructing traffic, and so they started arresting us.""

Mr Lockwood said the group stopped traffic from entering the market for about an hour between 5am and 6am.

In a tweet, Animal Rebellion described the protest as a ""vigil"".

""So many here, here for the fishes, for the thousands in the market, dead or dying, for the trillions killed this year,"" the group wrote.

Animal Rebellion says it is a ""mass volunteer movement"" calling on the government to end the ""destructive animal farming and   fishing industries"".

It wants the government to lead a ""transition to a just, sustainable plant-based food system"", according to the group's website.

The group has said it stands in ""solidarity"" with the climate change campaigners Extinction Rebellion.

More than 100 healthcare professionals also joined the sixth day of climate change protests in London on Saturday.

Doctors, nurses and medical students took part in the ""Health March for the Planet"" near oil giant Shell's London HQ, in which some protesters carried Extinction Rebellion flags and signs reading: ""Climate change is a health issue.""

6,The Independent,Broadsheet,2019,Piers Morgan attacks 'Mr Broccoli' climate protester in live TV interview; Good Morning Britain clashes with climate protester over plant-based diets,"A climate change protester dressed as a broccoli clashed with Piers Morgan during a live TV interview.

The man, who refused to give any name other than Mr Broccoli, warned the planet is in ""incredibly hot water"" because of climate change as he appeared on Good Morning Britain.

But he was met with opposition from Morgan, who claimed: ""You don't know the science.""

The guest, who appeared on the show in green face paint and broccoli floret-style headwear to promote a plant-based diet, replied: ""I'm just a broccoli at the end of the day.""

He then produced a banana from his pocket and held it to his ear while pretending to be on the phone.

The activist is part of the Animal Rebellion movement, an offshoot of climate group Extinction Rebellion, and was arrested on Sunday as part of the environmental protests in London.

Referencing climate protests, he said: ""I want people to feel like they can come and take part in this protest.""

During the interview, Reid asked: ""Can I just ask a straightforward question and without any comedy - are you a plant?

""Because your argument dressed as a broccoli just strikes me as so absurd that you're wearing a costume but you're trying to get a serious point across about veganism.

""Are you actually not part of Animal Rebellion and Extinction Rebellion at all but somebody who is trying to send up the whole movement?""

The protester replied: ""Not at all.""

When Reid asked if his appearance was a ""joke"", he said: ""I think given the gravity of the situation, some levity and humour is important.""

Viewers reacted to the interview using the hashtag #MrBroccoli, with some more keen on the vegetable-themed protester than others.

Twitter user Glen O'Hara, who was retweeted by Reid, said the interview was ""absolutely peak 2019"".

While Elliott Wright of The Only Way Is Essex said Mr Broccoli was a ""moron"", and that Morgan should have ""served him up on a plate"".

8,The Independent,Broadsheet,2020,"Animal rights protesters arrested in London after Trafalgar Square fountains dyed red in coronavirus warning; 'The government must begin a transition towards a plant-based food system or risk future zoonotic pandemics of catastrophic proportions,' says group","Two people have been arrested after protesters dyed the Trafalgar Square fountains in central London red.

The Animal Rebellion group, which says animal farming is risking future pandemics, warned government ministers have ""blood on their hands"".

While some activists waded fountain's waters, others held placards and staged a socially distanced protest in Trafalgar Square.

The Metropolitan Police said two people had been arrested on suspicion of criminal damage and taken into custody.

The protesters said they wanted to raise attention to animal exploitation which they say caused the coronavirus pandemic.

""We are here today to demand that the government prevent future pandemics by ending animal farming and transitioning to a plant-based food system,"" the group tweeted.

It added the government must ""protect the people, not support climate-destructive and exploitative industries"".

Stephanie Zupan, of Animal Rebellion said: ""The government must begin a transition towards a plant-based food system or risk future zoonotic pandemics of catastrophic proportions.""

Scientists believe Covid-19 developed at a market in China where species that don't mix in the wild were kept and slaughtered in close confinement.

The group said protests were also held in other cities, including Bristol, Brighton, Amsterdam, Barcelona and New York.

Animal Rebellion, which promotes mass civil disobedience in full public view, is also calling on the government to acknowledge that three out of every four new infectious diseases originate from animals, as stated by the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention.

""The warnings from Covid-19 could not be starker,"" said Ms Zupan.

Another protester, Kieran Blyth, added: ""The government are playing with the potential of tens of thousands more deaths.""

Members pointed to the Agriculture Bill going through the House of Lords, which could lead to imports of meat from lower-welfare animals.

A government spokesperson said: ""Every livestock farm in England, regardless of scale, must comply with our comprehensive animal-welfare legislation.

9,The Independent,Broadsheet,2021,McDonald's: Animal rights group blockades fast food chain's UK depots,"Environmental activits are blockading four McDonald's distribution centres in a bid to stop deliveries to the fast food giant's restaurants across the country this weekend.

Animal Rebellion say that some 50 demonstrators have used trucks and bamboo towers to stop lorries leaving depots in Hemel Hempstead, Basingstoke, Coventry and Heywood in Greater Manchester.

They have poured fake animal blood over signage with some protesters dressed as the chain's mascot, Ronald McDonald.

Demonstrators say they are targeting the chain because of its ""role in the climate emergency"" and are demanding McDonald's - which has 1,300 restaurants across the UK - commits to being fully plant-based by 2025.

Animal Rebellion spokesperson, James Ozden, who is taking part in the Coventry protest, said: ""The meat and dairy industry is destroying our planet: causing huge amounts of rainforest deforestation, emitting immense quantities of greenhouse gases and killing billions of animals each year.

""The only sustainable and realistic way to feed ten billion people is with a plant-based food system.""

Apparently referring to McDonald's newly-introduced McPlant meat-free menu, he added: ""Organic, free-range and 'sustainable' animal-based options simply aren't good enough.""

Nick More, renewable energy developer and member of Amazon Rebellion, accused the chain of trying to ""greenwash"" its reputation in recent years but said: ""There is no transparency in their supply chain or independent audit sufficient to support their claims that they are not a driver of deforestation.""

The group tweeted that it intends to remain at the sites for at least 24 hours and aims to cause ""significant disruption"" to McDonald's as its outlets restock over the weekend.

A second tweet called on McDonald's to personally engage with the activists at the protest sites, saying: ""We're waiting for them to come talk to us, or we'll stop their distribution to all 1,300 restaurants all day.""

13,The Independent,Broadsheet,2021,Animal Extinction protesters blockade McDonalds factory,"Animal Rebellion protesters have barricaded a McDonald's factory in Scunthorpe in a move to get the burger chain to switch to an entirely ""plant-based food menu by 2025.""

The 'animal and climate justice' movement said that around 100 protestors set up a blockade using trucks, tents, bamboo structures in the early hours of Thursday morning to stop the facility from distributing burgers. Trucks with the sign ""McMurder"" stood outside the factory while police vans encircled the area.

The campaigners, urging others to join in, said they will stay as long as it takes until McDonald's commits to changing towards a plant-based menu.

Accusing the global fast-food chain of poor labour conditions and wreaking havoc on the environment, the activists said that they would end the blockade if McDonald's makes the first step towards this goal by committing to becoming 20 per cent plant-based within one year.

McDonald's is just a symbol of the system they are trying to change, which is the entire animal agriculture industry, the activists said.

Professor Joy Carter, Emeritus Professor of Geochemistry and Health, University of Winchester, said there is no second chance in averting climate breakdown.

""We need to radically change our food system and it must start with the meat and dairy industry.""

""Until we make large-scale systemic changes and move towards a plant-based food system, we will continue to destroy our planet,"" Prof Carter said.

Rose Patterson, a spokesperson for Animal Rebellion, said, ""We're living in a time where massive change is possible, but our window to act on the climate crisis is closing quickly.""

The meat and dairy industries account for 80-90 per cent of Amazon deforestation, at least 18 per cent of global emissions, Patterson said.

""To save ourselves and the future of our children, we must start transitioning towards a plant-based food system.""

The activists accused the UK government and the agricultural industry of being lackadaisical in their approach to transition the UK agrarian industry to net-zero by 2050.

Independent thinktank RethinkX estimates that 90 per cent of jobs in the meat and dairy industry in the US will be lost by 2035.

Expecting similar trends to follow in the UK, Harley McDonald Eckersall from Animal Rebellion said not transitioning to plant based options will mean further economic and social damage, as we are going to see millions of people lose their jobs in the next decade.

""McDonald's has a responsibility to bring about this change before the choice is taken out of their hands.""

Demonstrators blocked the south side of the bridge with a vintage-looking single-decker which was quickly surrounded by police. A day earlier, traffic over Tower Bridge was halted by the protesters using a parked caravan.

19,The Independent,Broadsheet,2021,Animal Rebellion blockades UK's largest dairy factory,"Environmental activists have blocked the entrance and exit to the UK's largest dairy factory, preventing the delivery of thousands of pints of milk.

Protesters from Animal Rebellion, an off-shoot group of Extinction Rebellion, arrived at 5am yesterday morning and erected two wooden tower structures at the entrance and exit of Arla's factory in Aylesbury.

Around 50 activists are now camped out at the site, with some ""locked-on"" to a van and lying in the middle of the roads in and out of the dairy plant.

Police are at the scene and have started using a specialist removal team to remove protesters from the wooden teepee and make arrests.

Thames Valley officers are urging people to avoid the area and have put a road closure in place on the A41 to manage traffic.

Dairy giant, Arla Foods UK, which supplies milk to most major supermarkets, confirmed in a statement that it could not get any large vehicles in and out of its factory. At capacity, an average of 20 lorries usually access the site each hour.

The factory processes up to 420,000 pints of milk an hour and makes around 400 deliveries from the site each day.

Activist James Ozden, who is at the protest, said: ""We arrived quite close to 5am this morning and parked our van and put up our structure and equipment. The police came pretty soon after we got here and have been around for about four hours now.

""I think they are waiting for the process removal team to come because they are not equipped to remove us yet.

""There's a pretty huge queue of backlog lorries on both sides. It's definitely quite inconvenient and there are a lot of workers out here milling around because they don't have anything to do.

""There are no HGVs or milk product lorries coming in and out of Arla today.""

Mr Ozden predicted the activists could be there for two to three days, saying: ""we've got relatively strong kit and committed people.""

Around 20 people are ""locked on"" to various structures and other activists have set up tents and gazebos around the area.

Mr Ozden added: ""If we are going to address the climate crisis then we need to have a major shift from animal-based food products to plant-based. We are calling for an urgent transition.""

A spokesperson for Arla said: ""As a cooperative owned by farmers we are committed to producing dairy for the UK in the most sustainable way possible. We already make raw milk with around half the average emissions of dairy globally and intend to be carbon net zero by 2050.

""We are working with the police to limit the impact of this demonstration to both our customers and those living locally to the site.

""We have managed to complete our morning shift change over and all colleagues are safe, however, access to the site for our larger vehicles is being blocked. We are working to manage the impact of this.""

A spokesperson for Thames Valley Police said: ""Thames Valley Police officers are at the site of a protest outside the Arla dairy in Aylesbury.

""At 5.17am this morning reports were received that a number of protestors had gathered and blocked the entrance to the dairy. Officers attended the scene within minutes.

""A road closure has been put in place on the A41 to manage traffic and minimise disruption to the local community and businesses. We would advise people to avoid the area and find alternative routes. The road closure may be in place for some time.

""Officers are on scene and are liaising with the landowner, and those who have gathered to protest, and will be working to return normality to the site as soon as possible.""

They added that while the police force ""strives to facilitate the rights of the public to protest and demonstrate peacefully"", they would ""look to remove and if necessary arrest"" anyone believed to be engaged in ""direct action to disrupt lawful activity"".

Last month the dairy giant was forced to cut back on deliveries because of the impacts of the country-wide lorry driver shortage.

Arla's UK managing director Ash Amirahmadi said that the producer was struggling to supply some supermarkets with milk due to the crisis.

20,The Independent,Broadsheet,2021,Extinction Rebellion: More than 500 arrested during protests in London,"More than 500 arrests have been made during Extinction Rebellion's two weeks of protests in London.

Scotland Yard said 508 people had been arrested since the environmental group began its Impossible Rebellion protests on 23 August.

Saturday's ""March for Nature"" marked the final event in the group's fortnight of protests in the capital. The march was staged by sister groups Animal Rebellion and Nature Rebellion and sought to ""bring the voices of the forests to the streets,"" according to Animal Rebellion's Facebook page.

Extinction Rebellion UK's event website for the march drew attention to rising extinction rates and habitat loss, before calling for world leaders to cease all fossil fuel investment.

""A species goes extinct every 5 minutes. We have lost almost 70 per cent of all plant and animal life on this planet in just 50 years,"" the website said.

""Our feet march for the disappearing forests, coral reefs, prairies, marshlands, mangroves and beyond. Our eyes see the fires, floods, drought and destruction.

""Our hands rise and point to world leaders to stop this harm.

""Our demand is to stop all fossil fuel investment immediately.""

The demonstration began at Trafalgar Square around 1pm with speeches about decolonising conservation, and oil drilling in the Okavango Delta in Botswana, before thousands of protesters began their march, journeying past Buckingham Palace and ending in Hyde Park.

Protesters were photographed wearing colourful costumes, holding signs and banners that read ""Stop the Harm,"" ""Act Now"" and ""The Amazon Rainforest is at a Tipping Point"". Others dressed as animals, including bees and panda bears, and a giant pink octopus was wheeled through the streets of London by Marine Extinction group.

More than 100 police officers were stationed around Trafalgar Square , and many more were waiting for the protesters along the planned march route. Ten people were arrested throughout the course of the demonstration ""for a variety of offences,"" the Met Police said.

On Friday, Deputy Assistant Commissioner Matt Twist said that nearly 2,000 officers were involved in policing the Impossible Rebellion protests every day.

Speaking on Times Radio he said: ""It's not the number of protesters but it's the level of serious disruption that they're looking to cause, which is impacting on other Londoners.

""We've said right from the start, we know that Extinction Rebellion have the right to protest and the right to assemble.

""But what we also made clear is these are qualified rights and they have got to be balanced against the rights of the rest of London and Londoners, the people, the businesses, the communities who want to lawfully go about their business.

""Where we've seen cases of both very serious and totally unreasonable disruption looking to be caused, we have to take action and move in and make arrests.""

The two weeks of protests have seen protesters glue themselves to a McDonald's restaurant, a giant pink table erected in Oxford Circus, banks splattered in paint , and countless roads and bridges blocked throughout London.

21,The Independent,Broadsheet,2021,Animal Rebellion protesters scale outside of government Defra building in London,"Protesters from the environmental campaign group Animal Rebellion have scaled the outside of the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs building in Westminster.

The protesters posted a photo on social media on Tuesday morning of four people in hard hats and high-viz, seemingly half way up the Defra and Home Office building on Marsham Street, London.

A spokesperson for the Metropolitan Police said: ""Shortly after 6am we were alerted to a small group of protestors climbing the outside of a government building in Marsham Street to access the roof.

""Officers are on the scene with the London Fire Brigade and are engaging with the protestors. As yet, there have been no arrests.""

The building is home to the Department for Environmental, Food and Rural Affairs and the Home Office.

The protesters said they were scaling the building to demand ""government support for a plant-based food system at Cop26"". They added: ""The protestors have said that they will take action until the government defunds meat and subsidises a plant-based transition.""

They intend to remain on the building, suspended in hammocks, ""until UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson pledges to cut all taxpayer support for animal agriculture"".

Animal Rebellion is an off-shoot group of Extinction Rebellion, which is particularly focused on the impact of the meat industry on climate change.

Nathan McGovern, who was on the ground at the action, said that four activists had scaled the building at around 6am on Tuesday morning.

He said: ""The climbers plan to stay there indefinitely. They will be unfurling a banner that will be presenting the government with our demand that they should be investing in a plant based future. Then we will take it from there.

""There are three or four police cars here and they have shut the section of road in front of Defra and the Home Office. There are a couple of fire engines and an ambulance here as well.

""All the protesters have rucksacks and supplies with them. They are on the building with harnesses and ropes so they are safe and in no danger. It has been done in a very controlled, safe way.""

A spokesperson for the group, Bel Jacobs, said: ""The UK government is simultaneously saying that it is a world leader in climate change whilst propping up the unsustainable and unprofitable meat and dairy industry, one that emits disproportionate amounts of greenhouse gases.

""This hypocrisy has to end - we need to defund meat and subsidise plant-based alternatives instead.""

The Metropolitan Police said they were working ""as quickly as possible to remove those who have climbed the building in the safest way"".

They added: ""Working from height is incredibly complex and can be dangerous. With height, comes risk. We have specialist teams who train for these scenarios, but we must allow those officers to make a number of detailed assessments before they attempt to remove activists.

22,The Independent,Broadsheet,2021,Who are environmental activist group Animal Rebellion?,"The environmental activist group Animal Rebellion made headlines for scaling a Home Office building in Westminster on Tuesday.

The protesters said they were scaling the building to demand “government support for a plant-based food system at Cop26.” They added: “The protesters have said that they will take action until the government defunds meat and subsidises a plant-based tradition”.

Four activists intend to stay on the outside of the building, which houses the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, for as long as they can and have brought backpacks with supplies up with them.

So who are Animal Rebellion?
Animal Rebellion are an off-shoot group of the environmental activist group Extinction Rebellion. They started out by running themed days or events as part of Extinction Rebellions’ rebellion weeks, but have since branched out to organising their own separate “actions”.

The group were part of the Extinction Rebellion protests in August 2019 and said they began by declaring themselves “in open rebellion against the UK government on August 17 2019, whilst occupying Trafalgar Square with 10,000 people”.

On 7 October that year, Animal Rebellion organised a protest at Smithfields Market, the oldest meat market in the UK. They set up dozens of tents and demanded the market became vegan.

Earlier this year, on 27 August, Animal Rebellion ran another protest as part of Extinction Rebellion’s fortnight-long protest against the global climate crisis in London. Activists were arrested after dyeing the iconic Buckingham Palace fountains blood red in a protest against the use of crown land for hunting and animal agriculture.

What do they want?
Animal Rebellion activists have three main demands. The first, called “Tell the Truth”, calls on the government to declare a “climate and ecological emergency, working with other institutions to communicate the urgency for change.”

They argue that people can’t talk about the climate crisis without considering the impacts of animal agriculture.

Their second demand, “Act Now”, asks the government to act to “halt biodiversity loss and reduce greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2025.” They add that this cannot be done “without a transition to a just and sustainable plant-based food system”.

The third demand, “Beyond Politics”, calls for the creation of a “citizens’ assembly on climate and ecological justice”. A citizens’ assembly is a body formed to deliberate on certain issues and is made up of randomly selected citizens.

What protests have the group organised recently?
The environmental activists blocked the entrance and exit to the UK’s largest dairy factory in August this year. They erected two wooden tower structures at the entrance and exit of Arla’s factory in Aylesbury.

Around 50 protesters camped out at the site, with some “locked-on” to a van and lying in the middle of the roads in and out of the dairy plant. They were eventually removed by police officers

26,The Independent,Broadsheet,2021,Six things to look out for at Cop26 - and why the climate summit matters,"The Queen may no longer be attending , but Glasgow is set to become the focus of the world's attention this weekend, as the long-awaited climate summit Cop26 finally opens.

The two-week event is the latest international meeting aiming to rapidly bring down the emissions from the burning of greenhouse gases which are heating up our planet.

The UN has billed the summit as a ""crucial"" opportunity for countries to avoid the worst impacts of a warming world, including catastrophic sea level rises and extreme weather and food shortages. The ""conference of the parties"" has been described as the ""last chance saloon"" to plan and take action within an effective time frame.

Almost 200 world leaders, along with 20,000 delegates and tens of thousands of campaigners and protesters are set to descend on Glasgow, in a major effort to chart a more sustainable future for our species.

The summit follows a year of extreme weather around the world, in which storms and heatwaves have driven widespread flooding and wildfires across Africa, Europe, America, Asia and Australia.

As the impacts of the climate crisis are increasingly being felt by wealthy nations - many of which emit the greatest levels of greenhouse gases - there is an increasing expectation among campaigners that bolder action to tackle the crisis could finally happen in some form.

So what can we expect to see at Cop26?

Emissions cuts

The core aim of the summit is to agree levels by which countries must cut their greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuels.

At the moment, fossil fuel usage and associated emissions are still rising.

Under the terms of the Paris agreement, drawn up at Cop21 in 2015 in France, the world is aiming to reach net-zero emissions by the year 2050. The hope is that under this scenario any remaining emissions are balanced out by techniques for drawing fossil fuels out of the atmosphere.

Hitting this target will stop temperatures from rising 1.5C higher than they were in the pre-industrial era. A secondary aim of the Paris agreement was to keep temperature rises ""well below"" 2C.

At the coming summit, countries must set out their new targets for reducing emissions which are to take effect by 2030.

These policy promises are known as ""nationally determined contributions"" or NDCs.

However, less than a week ahead of the summit, the UN has warned that the new NDCs ""fall far short"" of what is required.

The latest round of promises from governments around the world will only take a further 7.5 per cent off projected global emissions for 2030, while cuts of 55 per cent are needed to meet the 1.5C Paris goal, and reductions of 30 per cent are needed to stay below 2C.

So at Cop26, all eyes will be on how the countries work out a way of bringing down this large gap.

This is vital because the new policies for 2030 currently put the world on track for a temperature rise this century of at least 2.7C, which UN chief Antonio Guterres last month described as a ""catastrophic pathway"".

Climate finance

Another key area in which the summit is already running into trouble is in climate finance for developing nations.

Back in 2009 at Cop15 in Copenhagen, wealthy nations promised to deliver $100bn (£72bn) a year for poorer countries to help build cleaner economies and help pay for climate crisis mitigation efforts.

But this week, new analysis has found the figure will not be met until 2023.

Mohamed Adow, director of Nairobi-based think tank Power Shift Africa, said: ""One hundred billion dollars is less than the UK alone is spending on the HS2 rail link, yet the combined wealth of all the world's developed nations refuses to stump up the cash to help tackle the climate crisis.""

Ahead of the summit, Cop26 president Alok Sharma said: ""We can and must do more to get finance flowing to developing nations.

""So in the lead-up to Cop26, it's vital we see further pledges from developed countries and action on key priorities such as access to finance and funding for adaptation.""

Which countries could throw a spanner in the works?

While there is broad international agreement that emissions must come down through reducing use of fossil fuels, there remains considerable antagonism over exactly how this is done and how quickly it should happen.

As well as representatives from some countries showing reluctance to attend the summit, including Russia's Vladimir Putin, who has said he won't travel to Glasgow, China's Xi Xinping, who is yet to commit to travelling, and Australia's Scott Morrison, who only recently confirmed his attendance, there are other indications of how the climate crisis is viewed by some administrations.

Last week, leaked documents revealed Australia, China, Saudi Arabia and India are among the nations attempting to water down a major forthcoming UN climate report.

Representatives of the countries made submissions to a panel of scientists urging them to remove key phrases or downplay the need to switch away from fossil fuels.

While the countries' efforts do not directly relate to the Cop26 negotiations, they provide considerable insight into their governments' economic concerns over how they deal with climate legislation and the threat they might perceive it to be.

For example, the leaks revealed that major beef producers Brazil and Argentina reportedly disputed assertions that the world needs to reduce its meat consumption in order to tackle the climate crisis.

Meanwhile India and several eastern European countries said the draft report should be more positive about nuclear power, while Australian officials challenged the idea that coal-fired power stations would need to close.

The end of coal

The UK has said the introduction of a new international agreement to phase out coal is a one of the key aims of the summit.

As Britain's dependence on coal hits an all-time low, and with plans to close the last coal-fired power stations in the next three years, it is an easy win for the country. But can the hosts convince countries like Australia, China and India to end their addiction to the world's most-polluting fossil fuel?

The British government said last month that around 480 gigawatts-worth of new coal power stations are planned around the world.

Mr Sharma said: ""So ahead of Cop26 and at the summit itself, we need governments to make those strong, clear commitments to end polluting coal generation and prioritise clean power.""

The UK-led effort to bring the world's biggest polluters on board with such an agreement, is another measure by which the success or failure of the summit might be measured.

Adaptation and nature-based solutions

In addition to agreeing cuts on harmful practices, one of the key purposes of the summit is to showcase the most beneficial methods of addressing the impacts of the climate crisis, adapting to the changing world and preparing for the reality of a warming planet.

This is also where the summit will reconcile the link between the human-driven climate crisis, and the resulting environmental emergencies including the biodiversity crisis.

Both the climate crisis and biodiversity crisis cannot be solved without addressing the other.

Agriculture, forestry and other land use account for nearly a quarter of all global greenhouse gas emissions, according to the UK government. However, this sector also supports global food production, and millions of jobs.

At the conference, one of the key messages is that nature-based solutions are cheap and straightforward.

Expanding forests will clean the air and support greater levels of biodiversity; rewilding projects can deliver climate gains, from sequestering carbon in trees and peat bogs, to mangroves defending coastlines; while wildlife reintroductions can improve the function of ecosystems to boost vegetation, prevent flooding and reduce the impact of heatwaves.

Famous faces, protests and fringe events

International summits of this kind are not just about officials debating one another behind closed doors, but are also a carnival of fringe events, with pressure groups, campaigners and protesters well represented.

Greta Thunberg will speak to ""tens of thousands"" of climate campaigners at the Cop26 Coalition's Global Day for Climate Justice rally, on Saturday 6 November.

She will join Mitzi Jonelle Tan from the Philippines, Vanessa Nakate from Uganda, and Scottish activist Darren McGarvey, also known as rapper Loki, who will all speak to those in attendance.

She will also take part in the Climate Strike march from Glasgow's Kelvingrove Park to George Square on Friday 5 November.

Writing on Twitter she said: ""On Friday Nov 5 I'll join the climate strike in Glasgow -during COP26 Climate justice also means social justice and that we leave no one behind.

""So we invite everyone, especially the workers striking in Glasgow, to join us. See you there!""

Rail workers in the RMT union are striking throughout the two-week conference.

Meanwhile, refuse and recycling workers from more than half of Scotland's local authorities will also be out on strike from 8 to 12 November, along with school cleaners, janitors and catering staff.

Sir David Attenborough is also attending the event. Speaking ahead of the summit this week, the broadcaster said leaders must act now or ""it'll be too late"" for the planet.

He told the BBC: ""Every month that passes, it becomes more and more incontrovertible, the changes to the planet that we are responsible for that are having these devastating effects.""

Extinction Rebellion and spin-off campaigns such as Animal Rebellion and Ocean Rebellion - all of which aim to preserve biodiversity through direct action campaigns - will also be in attendance, organising events and stunts to draw attention to the role the climate crisis, and those who facilitate it, play in making the planet less hospitable to life.

27,The Independent,Broadsheet,2022,Activists who scaled government building to face fresh trial,"Activists are to face a fresh trial over allegations that they scaled a government building.

Orla Coghlan, 26, Jamie Ozden, 25, and Annabel Berwick, 19 are believed to be members of Animal Rebellion , an off-shoot of Extinction Rebellion.

They were among a group of protesters who allegedly climbed the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) building in Westminster at around 6am on October 26.

Inspector Michael Richards told a one-day trial hearing at Westminster Magistrates' Court in central London that the Home Secretary's private protection officer had wanted to access the building in Marsham Street because of an ""essential meeting"".

He told the court that Priti Patel was put at ""additional risk"" by the protest.

Mr Richards said: ""I had to formulate a plan to get the Home Secretary into the building while not being at risk from the protesters at a height.

""It did create additional risk to the Home Secretary at that time.""

Protesters who had climbed the building were approximately 20 metres (65ft) in the air and had dropped a banner that read: ""Cop26 invest in a plant-based future"".

Coghlan and Ozden, both from Tottenham, north London, and Berwick, of Cambridge, denied a charge of aggravated trespass which stated that they failed ""to leave the land"".

At the end of Friday's hearing, the prosecution laid a new charge of aggravated trespass with intent to obstruct or cause unlawful activity against all the defendants.

The hearing was halted and a new trial at the same venue was set for two days from June 8.

Earlier the court had also heard that the London Fire Brigade (LFB) and the ambulance service plus members of the public were at the scene, which drew attention from the press.

Police removal officers, who are able to climb buildings, were called to help get the protesters down.

Mr Richards said his ""main consideration was the safety of the climbers and the people below"" as they could have fallen or dropped something on passers-by who were at ground level.

He closed Marsham Street and gave an official warning at 8.54am to the protesters through a megaphone.

Mr Richards said: ""I heard it was a regular defence for people to say that they did not hear or understand the warning that was given.

""The London Fire Brigade gave me a loudhailer which they said could be heard as they assist in getting people out of buildings.""

He tested the equipment for sound on police officers who were on the ground and around 40 metres (131ft) away.

""I spoke to an officer who said they could hear me with the loudhailer,"" he told the court.

Mr Richards said he gave his warning while standing slightly back at the foot of the building and while looking straight upwards.

He estimated the protesters were about 20-30 metres (65-98ft) away. He and other officers had asked if they were OK before the warning was given, the court heard.

There was no response or comment from the protesters, who were wearing harnesses, and eventually left the building at 6pm. Mr Richards recalled the protesters appeared to be talking to each other during the demonstration and that red smoke flares were set off.

During the protest he had been contacted by a chief inspector about reopening the road. He said: ""I was under pressure to open up the road.

""It was an iconic location and MPs needed to be able to take their meetings.""

On the possibility that they may not have heard the warning, Mr Richards told the court: ""I find that unlikely - anything is possible.""

28,The Independent,Broadsheet,2022,Climate activists arrested in protest over oil links to factory farming,"Four activists have been arrested outside government offices as they highlighted links between oil and factory farming.

Members of the Scrap Factory Farming campaign and direct action organisation Animal Rebellion , part of Extinction Rebellion, were demonstrating outside the headquarters of the government's Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra).

It came on the day that Just Stop Oil protesters halted a tanker near the M4 in west London, causing traffic chaos.

Those activists were arrested after police blocked off the road.

At the Defra building near Westminster in central London, props resembling barrels of oil were placed outside, leaking what the activists said was a plant-based oil-like substance from them.

The demonstrators, who say large amounts of damaging oil are used in intensive animal agriculture, created cow hoofprints and chicken footprints in the liquid on the pavement.

They held placards with slogans saying ""Defund Oil. Scrap Factory Farming"".

Spokesperson Robert Gordon said: ""Factory farming is fuelled by oil. A huge amount of land and oil-based fertilisers are used to grow crops, like soya and grains, for animal feed to be given to animals cruelly kept in sheds.

""Farming in this way is incredibly oil-intensive and inefficient, contributing to the climate and ecological crises that threaten our collective future.""

Animal feed prices have gone up 70 per cent in a year, he said, due to rising fuel costs.

""This shows that animal agriculture is unsustainable for farmers, as well as for the planet, owing to their reliance on unpredictable, expensive, and environmentally damaging fossil fuel supplies.

A group of demonstrators were dragged by police out of the path of a military band as they marched along at around 10.10am.

Pro-vegan climate and animal rights campaign group Animal Rebellion said 25 of its supporters were involved in the disruption ""due to the Crown's inaction on the climate emergency and their continued support for meat, fishing, and dairy, a leading contributor to climate breakdown"".

Some of the protesters managed to sit down in the road before being pulled away by officers.

One of those sitting wore a golden crown around a hat, while the other sat facing the soldiers holding a piece of paper.

Another person walked ahead of the band holding a small poster which read ""Reclaim Royal Land"" above their head.

Despite the disturbance, the band marched on and continued with the parade as police officers detained members of the group to the side.

The Metropolitan Police said officers made 12 arrests for obstruction of the highway.

The force said on Twitter: ""A number of arrests have been made of people who attempted to enter the ceremonial route in The Mall at approximately 10.10hrs today.

30,The Independent,Broadsheet,2021,Animal Rebellion protesters tackled by police at Trooping the Colour after running into jubilee parade,"Climate protesters have been tackled by police at the Trooping of the Colour event after running into the parade during the first official day of Queen's Platinum Jubilee celebrations.

Animal Rebellion (AR) said it disrupted the event in protest at the ""Crown's inaction"" on the climate emergency and ""continued support for the meat, fishing and dairy"" industries.

Protesters could be seen running past barriers lining the Trooping the Colour procession route, but were quickly stopped by the heavy police presence.

Crowds of people who had turned out to watch the royal celebrations could be heard booing as the men were taken away by police.

Around 25 climate activists disrupted the royal procession on Pall Mall. The Crown is one of the largest landowners in the UK and AR is calling on the monarchy to do more to tackle greenhouse gas emissions.

AR said it is urging the ""immediate transition to a plant-based future and rewilding.""

Beau King Houston, one of those taking action: said ""The royal family has had decades to lead the way on a just transition to plant-based farming and has failed to do so.

""This transition is common sense and simple, we all win. 76 per cent of currently farmed land could be rewilded and absorb carbon from the atmosphere.

""This would restore nature, spare billions of animals, and present a solution to the climate emergency, all in one act.""

Robert Gordon, a spokesperson for the group, said: ""These jubilee celebrations are set to cost the taxpayer tens, if not hundreds of millions of pounds.

""All whilst we are struggling through the cost-of-living crisis and families across the country are increasingly reliant on foodbanks.

""Instead, this obscene amount of money could have been used to provide instant food security and kick start a plant-based future where no child is left hungry or terrified by climate collapse. We must reclaim royal land for this.""

35,The Independent,Broadsheet,2022,Animal Rebellion protesters splatter paint on London hunting shops,"Animal Rebellion (AR) activists vandalised hunting shops with paint as “hundreds” of fellow campaigners protested in central London on Saturday to demand a “plant-based future”.

Campaigners poured red paint inside Farlows, a hunting and fishing shop on Pall Mall , and daubed paint on the windows of William Evans, a shooting supply shop in nearby St James’s Street, while others took and emptied milk from supermarkets.

The group, an offshoot of Extinction Rebellion , describes itself as a “mass movement using non-violent civil disobedience to call for a just, sustainable plant-based food system”.

After putting out a message “calling all vegans to occupy London”, AR said protesters brought London’s West End “to a standstill” as people marched from Green Park to Piccadilly Circus.

They are calling on Prime Minister Liz Truss and Environment Secretary Ranil Jayawardena to tackle what they call the “climate, ecological and cost-of-living crises”.

Fellow environmental campaigners from Just Stop Oil were also seen blocking a road on Park Lane in central London as part of their efforts to stop future gas and oil projects from proceeding.

It comes after two activists from Animal Rebellion targeted Fortnum & Mason and Selfridges and poured milk out in the high-end department stores in central London on Friday.

Dillon Parsons, 21, from Preston, a spokesperson for AR and a film production student at the University for the Creative Arts, said he has been involved with the campaign group for two years.

On Friday afternoon, he said: “We are currently at Trafalgar Square. There are I’d say a couple of hundred activists and we are all sat on the ground and demanding that the Government transition to a plant-based future because the UK Government has proved that they don’t know how to respond to crises any more.

“We’ve seen through the cost-of-living crisis and the climate crisis that they are not treating the public well and they have their own pockets as their first priorities.

“We know that animal farming and fishing is the key cause to the climate crisis, so if we transition away to a plant-based food system we can not only stop 76 billion animals a year from being killed, we can feed the whole population several times over, we can free up 76% of global agricultural land … to give every person and all future generations a chance of having a better future on this planet.”

He said he was not present when the shops were vandalised, but added: “If the Government responded to us and gave us a chance of a plant-based future we wouldn’t have to do actions like this but causing this level of disruption, if this is what is going to get us heard, that’s the actions we’ve got to take.”

39,The Independent,Broadsheet,2022,Tory peer Zac Goldsmith sacked as environment minister,"Tory peer Zac Goldsmith has been sacked as an environment minister as part of a major overhaul of Government personnel under Liz Truss.

It is understood that Lord Goldsmith, a close ally of Ms Truss’s predecessor Boris Johnson , no longer holds the animal welfare brief.

However, he retains his job at the Foreign Office , where his responsibilities include the Pacific and international environment.

The dismissal comes despite Downing Street saying the reshuffle had been stopped, as politics largely ground to a halt during the period of mourning following the Queen’s death.

The sacking of the long-time environmentalist could add to concerns the new administration could turn away from green issues.

Lord Goldsmith himself warned against such a shift during the contest to replace Mr Johnson.

Speaking in Parliament in July, he said: “My hope … is to try very, very hard to shine a light on these issues and encourage the candidates that eventually make it to the top to just recognise that if they walk away from these issues, they not only will be punished by the electorate, they absolutely must be punished by the electorate.

“It is your duty and our duty, and everyone else’s duty, to punish any leader of any credible party that does not take these issues seriously because they simply do not merit the privilege of government.”

The Guardian reported that Lord Goldsmith said he was “very sad” to be going in a farewell letter to staff at the the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra).

He wrote: “We have so much more to do to turn the tide here.

“The UK is, after all, one of the world’s most nature-depleted countries. But if Defra continues to get the backing you need and deserve across government, you can and you will turn the tide.”

The appointment of Ranil Jayawardena as Ms Truss’s Environment Secretary has raised concerns among environmental groups including Animal Rebellion.

Dr Alice Brough, 31, a livestock veterinarian from Gloucestershire, recently said: “Liz Truss and Ranil Jayawardena’s attitude of prioritising free trade, no matter the cost, has shown shocking neglect for British farmers, and therefore the rest of us struggling with the cost-of-living crisis.”

Mr Johnson made Lord Goldsmith a life peer shortly after voters dumped him as the MP for Richmond Park in a defeat to the Lib Dems in 2019.

It paved the way for Mr Johnson to hand Lord Goldsmith a job in Government, first in the Foreign Office before making him an environment minister.

“The UK is, after all, one of the world’s most nature-depleted countries. But if Defra continues to get the backing you need and deserve across government, you can and you will turn the tide.”

The appointment of Ranil Jayawardena as Ms Truss’s Environment Secretary has raised concerns among environmental groups including Animal Rebellion.

Dr Alice Brough, 31, a livestock veterinarian from Gloucestershire, recently said: “Liz Truss and Ranil Jayawardena’s attitude of prioritising free trade, no matter the cost, has shown shocking neglect for British farmers, and therefore the rest of us struggling with the cost-of-living crisis.”

Mr Johnson made Lord Goldsmith a life peer shortly after voters dumped him as the MP for Richmond Park in a defeat to the Lib Dems in 2019.

It paved the way for Mr Johnson to hand Lord Goldsmith a job in Government, first in the Foreign Office before making him an environment minister.

Lord Goldsmith’s office has been contacted for comment."
40,The Independent,Broadsheet,2022,"Campaigners claim targeting of milk depots has led to empty shop shelves
","Campaigners have claimed their efforts to disrupt dairy distribution facilities have led to supermarket shelves being left empty of milk in north London.

Climate activist group Animal Rebellion said it has been causing significant disruption to a number of dairy distribution facilities over five days, including blocking and occupying sites and damaging milk trucks.

They paused their action in response to the death of the Queen.

The disruption we caused is still being felt across the dairy supply chain

Dan Kidby, Animal Rebellion

But the protesters, who want to see a transition to plant-based alternatives to milk and dairy products to tackle the climate crisis, claim their actions are now having an effect on consumers’ access to milk.

Animal Rebellion wants to see farmers supported to make the switch from meat and dairy production to a plant-based food system, to free up land for rewilding that can draw down carbon dioxide from the atmosphere through new forests and plants, helping curb the climate crisis and protecting nature.

Dan Kidby, co-founder of Animal Rebellion, said: “We paused our non-violent campaign out of respect for the British people following the news of Queen Elizabeth’s death, but the disruption we caused is still being felt across the dairy supply chain.

“We fully stand by our actions and are demanding Government action to transition to a plant-based food system which is the key solution to the climate crisis.”

Animal Rebellion said the shortages of fresh milk in north London, which they hope will encourage consumers to switch to plant-based alternatives, were due to actions targeting Arla’s depot in Hatfield, Hertfordshire.

We are working as quickly and safely as we can to continue delivering nutritious dairy around the country

Arla spokesperson

In a statement, a spokesperson for Arla said: “We’re extremely disappointed that protesters have caused criminal damage to some of our vehicles at our Hatfield site.

“All protesters have been removed from site by local police, however due to the damage caused some deliveries will be slightly delayed.

“The site is now fully operational, and we are working as quickly and safely as we can to continue delivering nutritious dairy around the country.”

51,The Independent,Broadsheet,2022,Road-blocking protesters have not yet caused major disruption – police chief,"Protesters blocking main roads in central London have not yet caused major disruption despite “enormous” policing resources being taken up dealing with the demonstrations, the new head of the Metropolitan Police has said.

Commissioner Sir Mark Rowley told the London Assembly Police and Crime Committee that officers have to wait until protests by Just Stop Oil and Animal Rebellion are deemed to meet a legal threshold of causing major disruption before they can be shut down.

His officers are in touch with Transport for London, local councils and the emergency services several times per day to check the level of disruption caused.

Sir Mark said: “Over the last 11 days, all of those partners have been of a view that it doesn’t cause serious disruption.”

He went on: “As soon as we have evidence of that serious disruption either being crossed as a line, or a good prospect of it being crossed, we’ll start being more assertive with our powers.”

So far there have been 338 arrests, mainly supporters of Just Stop Oil, but also a few of Animal Rebellion.

Sir Mark said: “This has been a really difficult operation over the 11 days so far. And it annoys me how much it’s taking away from policing local communities.

“In 11 days we have put 2,156 officer days into doing this, so that’s a couple of hundred per day roughly.

“That’s an enormous amount of policing resources that aren’t tackling issues that matter to local communities, aren’t dealing with knife crime, aren’t dealing with violence against women and girls.”

On Tuesday, Home Secretary Suella Braverman said she expects police to use the “full powers” given to them by the Government after fossil fuel protesters reportedly obstructed a fire engine and an ambulance.

Ms Braverman branded the actions of demonstrators from Just Stop Oil in west London as “self-defeating” and “completely indefensible”.

Videos shared online on Tuesday show a fire engine and an ambulance on blue lights unable to get through traffic after 32 protesters – some gluing themselves to the road – blocked three routes in Knightsbridge and Brompton Road in London.

Just Stop Oil said it had paused its blockade to let a fire engine through.

The law is very clear that just blocking a road in itself isn't automatically serious disruption

Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Mark Rowley

Sir Mark told the committee: “The law is very clear that just blocking a road in itself isn’t automatically serious disruption and, whilst it’s committing some offences, in terms of obstruction of the highway, those aren’t prosecutable if it’s a lawful protest as long as it doesn’t exceed reasonable bounds.

“And that’s the judgments police officers have to make the whole time.

“The fact I’ve been putting 200 officers a day into policing this, I don’t welcome that, that’s not good for London’s communities, frankly. But I have to work with the legal framework.

“I would love to be able to close these down more quickly and spend less policing resources on it at the moment, and as soon as partners who have the expertise to assess the impact on the road network and the road services, as soon as they say this is heading towards crossing the line, we’ll be in there straightaway.

He went on: “As soon as we have evidence of that serious disruption either being crossed as a line, or a good prospect of it being crossed, we’ll start being more assertive with our powers.”

So far there have been 338 arrests, mainly supporters of Just Stop Oil, but also a few of Animal Rebellion.

Sir Mark said: “This has been a really difficult operation over the 11 days so far. And it annoys me how much it’s taking away from policing local communities.

“In 11 days we have put 2,156 officer days into doing this, so that’s a couple of hundred per day roughly.

“That’s an enormous amount of policing resources that aren’t tackling issues that matter to local communities, aren’t dealing with knife crime, aren’t dealing with violence against women and girls.”

On Tuesday, Home Secretary Suella Braverman said she expects police to use the “full powers” given to them by the Government after fossil fuel protesters reportedly obstructed a fire engine and an ambulance.

Ms Braverman branded the actions of demonstrators from Just Stop Oil in west London as “self-defeating” and “completely indefensible”.

Videos shared online on Tuesday show a fire engine and an ambulance on blue lights unable to get through traffic after 32 protesters – some gluing themselves to the road – blocked three routes in Knightsbridge and Brompton Road in London.

Just Stop Oil said it had paused its blockade to let a fire engine through.

The law is very clear that just blocking a road in itself isn't automatically serious disruption

Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Mark Rowley

Sir Mark told the committee: “The law is very clear that just blocking a road in itself isn’t automatically serious disruption and, whilst it’s committing some offences, in terms of obstruction of the highway, those aren’t prosecutable if it’s a lawful protest as long as it doesn’t exceed reasonable bounds.

“And that’s the judgments police officers have to make the whole time.

“The fact I’ve been putting 200 officers a day into policing this, I don’t welcome that, that’s not good for London’s communities, frankly. But I have to work with the legal framework.

“I would love to be able to close these down more quickly and spend less policing resources on it at the moment, and as soon as partners who have the expertise to assess the impact on the road network and the road services, as soon as they say this is heading towards crossing the line, we’ll be in there straightaway.

“But until that point, I don’t have a legal power to do that.”"

54,The Independent,Broadsheet,2022,Angry motorists drag Just Stop Oil protesters out of road as 100 activists arrested,"Angry motorists have been filmed dragging climate activists out of the road during Just Stop Oil's latest protest in the capital.

The Metropolitan Police made 100 arrests over this weekend as Just Stop Oil campaigners blocked roads in London in a bid to get the government to act on the environmental crisis.

Drivers in Westminster were seen dragging protesters out of the road near the parliament, as one confronted the climate group by saying: “I have to go to hospital... stop interfering with us.”

One activist was also filmed climbing on top of a police van and glueing his hand to it in Sunday’s protest.

A spokesman for the Met Police said: “More than 100 people have been arrested following a weekend of protest-related activity by environmental groups.

“18 protestors from Animal Rebellion who blocked Westminster Bridge on Saturday evening and refused to leave when requested to do so were arrested.

“Earlier that day, 24 protestors linked to the Just Stop Oil group were arrested for obstructing the highway after they blocked Edgware Road/Upper Berkeley Street and Marylebone Road/Baker Street.

“On Sunday afternoon, 47 people from the same group were arrested when they blocked roads in the vicinity of Piccadilly Circus with some using locking devices to try and delay police interventions.”

Sunday marks the ninth day of protests in a row as members of Just Stop Oil demand an end to the use of oil and gas. Protesters say they will continue to disrupt the roads every day in October until fossil fuel use is tackled.

The activist who climbed on top of the police van was brandishing a banner and shouting to people passing by about the cause. He yelled: “I’m angry. Sad…Where’s the outrage?”

It comes after one person protesting on Saturday needed medical care after being pulled from the road by a driver, the group said.

Just Stop Oil said in a statement: “We are not backing down. Today, the Occupation of Westminster enters its 9th day. Massive disruption has been caused throughout the borough with multiple bridges and key A roads repeatedly blocked.

“Yesterday, a group of Just Stop Oil supporters remained resolutely nonviolent when confronted by the understandably frustrated members of the public.

“One supporter required emergency medical treatment due to having been removed from the road by a member of the public.

“The disruption will end when the government makes a statement that it will halt all future licensing and consents for the exploration, development and production of fossil fuels in the UK.”

Climate protests have been going on since last Saturday in London, with activists blocking areas like Waterloo Bridge and Trafalgar Square as well as Westminster.

55,The Independent,Broadsheet,2022,Outcry as police return beagles stolen from Cambridgeshire research facility,"Celebrities and campaigners have condemned police returning two beagles who were stolen from a Cambridgeshire research facility.

Downton Abbey star Peter Egan and singer Will Young are among those who have spoken out after Cambridgeshire Police gave the dogs back to MBR Acres in Wyton.

It comes after police officers were called to the facility just before 6am on Tuesday to reports of a break-in and “protesters at the front gates”.

Protest group Animal Rebellion said in a statement that 12 of its supporters got inside the facility at 5.30am and took 18 beagles.

Cambridgeshire Police said on Friday it had returned two dogs – named Love and Libby by campaigners – to MBR Acres after they were recovered by officers.

The force said the Home Office and Animals in Science Regulation Unit supported their return for wellbeing reasons.

However, the move has prompted an outcry from celebrities and campaigners, who called it “horrifying”.

Egan, an actor who has also starred in After Life, said: “Love and Libby represent the hope of all the beagles bred for lab experiments at MBR Acres.

“The hope is that they may, with a degree of compassion from MBR, be allowed a life free from pain and death. We ask them to show some humility and mercy: give them life, set them free to be homed with a loving family.”

Meanwhile, singer Young said he was “shocked” and “disgusted” by MBR Acres’ decision to ask for the beagles back.

“Love and Libby will most likely be put down due to contamination or put down after being taken back in to be tortured through testing,” Young said.

“They were shown freedom and love and now are taken back into the hell hole that is allowed to operate under Home Office regulations.”

Dr Alice Brough, a qualified vet with the Animal Rebellion protest group and director of the Progressive Veterinary Association, also accused the Home Office of seeing nothing wrong with “needlessly torturing animals by the thousands”.

“The fact that the police are citing the dogs’ wellbeing as a reason to return them to a facility appearing to be in breach of welfare regulations, and knowing the unimaginable pain and suffering they will face in a laboratory, is frankly horrifying,” she added.

Cambridgeshire Police said 14 people were arrested earlier this week after the dogs were taken from the research facility.

The force said in a statement on Friday: “We recognise the strong feelings this issue has raised in many people, however, we had no legal justification to retain the dogs and therefore were compelled to return them.”

It said the Home Office confirmed that MBR Acres is a licenced establishment that is compliant with requirements of the Animals Act 1986.

All establishments licensed to breed or supply animals are subject to the full requirements of the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act which provides specific and detailed protections for animals used in science

Home Office spokesperson

“The Home Office and its Animals in Science Regulation Unit (ASRU), which administers and enforces the 1986 Act, supported the return of the dogs for their wellbeing,” police added.

MBR Acres said it is “a fully licenced establishment and a lawful breeder of beagle dogs that are specially bred for human and animal research in an environment compliant with our licences”.

A spokesperson previously said in a statement: “We are appalled by these actions. Dogs bred for research need careful rehabilitation not to be harmed by a sudden change to their environment.

“This unlawful extreme action has placed stress on our animals and staff by totally disrupting our daily activity to take care for the welfare of our dogs on site.”

61,The Independent,Broadsheet,2022,"David Attenborough skips to the end of nature docs to ‘find out what happens’, producer claims","Sir David Attenborough skips to the end of nature documentaries before watching them, a BBC producer has admitted.

According to BBC Natural History executive producer Mike Gunton, Attenborough likes to see the outcome of the programmes he narrates.

“He often spins to the end [of the programme before he narrates it] to find out what happens,” Gunton told The Daily Telegraph.

“He just wants to ensure that everything is OK, which I think is charmingly atypical of him.”

Gunton said that, while Attenborough wasn’t an “animal lover”, he cared what happens to the creatures in his documentaries.

In 2013, Attenborough told Metro that he is “intoxicated by animals” and has owned gibbons, chimpanzees, chameleons, snakes, and lemurs. The only creatures he does not like, however, are rats.

Last month, a climate protester from Animal Rebellion was arrested after reportedly approaching Attenborough at a Michelin-star restaurant on the south coast of England.

Dorset Police said Emma Smart, 45, was arrested after allegedly causing a disturbance and refusing to comply with officers after they asked her to leave Catch At The Old Fish Market in Weymouth.

According to Animal Rebellion, a protest group calling for a plant-based food system and a mass re-wilding programme, Smart targeted his visit to the Catch restaurant because of its expensive seafood menu.

Smart said in a statement: “The Catch is a symbol of excess and inequality in today’s world. Weymouth has average wages amongst the lowest in the UK and is at huge risk of sea level rises, yet this restaurant still continues business as usual amongst the worst cost-of-living crisis many will ever experience.

“We don’t need another documentary series showing us that we are losing, some 150 species going extinct globally every single day. What we need is action. Sir David is in a unique position to tell the truth about the biodiversity crisis.”

68,The Independent,Broadsheet,2022,"11-month High Court injunction granted to deter unlawful M25 protests

","A new injunction granted by the High Court and lasting almost a year could see Just Stop Oil activists face fresh penalties for demonstrating on the M25.

National Highways said it secured the civil order to “prevent unlawful protests” on the country’s busiest motorway after a series of stunts during which members of the environmental group scaled gantries and caused major traffic disruption.

The injunction, granted on Monday before Mr Justice Soole, will remain in place until just before midnight on November 15 2023 or until further order.

It means that anyone entering, remaining upon or affixing themselves to any object or to any structure on the M25 may have civil proceedings launched against them for contempt of court.

They could face imprisonment, an unlimited fine, the seizure of assets or a combination of these sanctions.

Some 65 individuals who were arrested by police as a result of their involvement in Just Stop Oil protests on the M25 gantries are named specifically in the injunction.

This includes some individuals supporting protests from Animal Rebellion and Insulate Britain , according to National Highways.

The injunction was secured in addition to a court order obtained by National Highways earlier this year that targeted protesters including those from Insulate Britain.

Transport Secretary Mark Harper said: “The reckless, selfish actions of a small group of protestors has stopped children getting to school, people getting to work, and emergency service workers from their critical work.”

He added: “Free speech and lawful protest is a cornerstone of our democracy, but putting peoples safety and livelihoods at risk due to selfish and unlawful protest activity will not be tolerated.”

Sean Martell, National Highways’ head of service delivery in the South East, said: “Millions of people rely on the strategic road network every day and they have a right to expect it to operate as it should.

“Climbing on structures such as gantries is extremely dangerous – both for the protesters themselves and motorists – and we’re committed to doing all we can to seek to prevent a small minority from causing disruption on the network.

“We’re extremely concerned that the M25 will continue to be targeted by protesters and this underlines the importance and need for the civil injunctions to deter unlawful protest activity.”

It comes after a group of five Just Stop Oil activists received suspended prison sentences for breaching an injunction by blocking access to a petrol station.

Ruth Cook, 70, Joy Corrigan, 71, Dr Patrick Hart, 36, Stephen Jarvis, 66, and George Oakenfold, 78, all admitted breaking terms of a civil order granted to Thurrock Council and Essex County Council.

The local authorities secured the injunction in May to “restrain unlawful acts of protest” in their areas, including forbidding blocking any petrol station and interfering with deliveries or refuelling, the court was told.

Mr Justice Bourne said the case involved a “deliberate flouting of a court order” and that the harm caused was “not lessened” by protesters having “conscientious motives”.",Left-center Bias,1,489,"11-month High Court injunction granted to deter unlawful M25 protests

Animal Rebellion said in a statement that they are campaigning for a plant-based food system and the creation of a mass-rewilding programme.

Lucia Alexander said in a statement provided by the group that Restaurant Gordon Ramsay was the “perfect example” of inequality in the UK.

“Whilst Gordon Ramsay serves food costing a minimum of £155 per person, more than two million people are relying on food banks in this cost of living crisis,” she continued.

“Instead of restaurants making colossal profits at the expense of animals, workers and our climate, we need to feed everyone by supporting farmers and fishing communities in a transition to a plant-based food system.”

Animal Rebellion says that such a system “required 75 per cent less farmland to grow food” and will allow “millions of additional people” to be fed without relying on “exploitative and inefficient animal farming industries”.

The protest comes after two Animal Rebellion activists were arrested on Friday after reportedly attempting to approach Sir David Attenborough while he was dining at a Michelin-starred restaurant in Weymouth.

Dorset Police said Emma Smart, 45, was arrested after allegedly causing a disturbance and refusing to comply with officers after she was asked to leave Catch At The Old Fish Market.

Gail Bradbrook clocked up 11,000 air miles as she flew to Costa Rica for a week's £2,500 stay at the reat New Life Iboga retreat then a week touring the tropical paradise.

Last year the 47-year-old helped set up the XR climateprotest campaign which is a week into two weeks disruptions across London.

Thousands of protesters brought the capital to standstill last week as they blocked roads and bridges, forcing ambulances to be diverted and causing mayhem for motorists. Some protesters handcuffed themselves to cars or glued themselves to government buildings. Activists occupied London City Airport and militant vegan offshoot Animal Rebellion took over Smithfield Meat Market.

Spirit of the otter

Yesterday the activists caused more chaos in London - and the mayhem is set to continue this week.

The leftie XR group is calling for a reduction in air travel and wants the Government to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2025.

Yet Bradbrook, who has posted about the need to ground aircraft, proudly put pictures on Facebook during her 2016 Costa Rica jaunt - which left a carbon footprint of 2.6TONNES of CO2 emissions. One photo was of her in a flowery dress at the beach taking snaps of monkeys.

She revealed that her holiday of self-discovery included taking hallucinogenic drugs that inspired her calling ""to get with the spirit of the otter"".

And she said it was ""filled with nature and the warm sea"", cooing over lizards, iguanas, birds that ""nick your breakfast"" and monkeys that ""smash mangoes on the roofs"". She also gushed that she wanted to use her visit to ""express my most passionate self"" in ""the most filthiest, animal way"".

Bradbrook said she contacted a spirit known as Grandmother Ayahuasca and got a ""kick up the a*** on negative habits"".

Tory MP Paul Scully last night said of her jaunt: ""This is blind hypocrisy from a group that's spent days blighting people's travel plans.

""Just like their Corbynista backers, they say one thing and do another. And as we've seen already, they are more interested in creating a scene than offering solutions - all at taxpayers' expense. Only Boris Johnson and the Conservatives are taking world-leading action li t h W h on climate change. We have reduced emissions by a quarter since coming to office in 2010, the fastest reduction by any G20 nation, and boosted renewables to record levels.""

Bradbrook championed the Keep It Grounded ""mass civil disobedience"" campaign at City Airport last week.

Her XR army also joined with the Plane Truth Procession to protest outside the World Aviation Festival in Islington, North London, last month.

Ahead of the event, the XR website proclaimed: ""Scientists make it crystal clear that without rapid reduction of passenger numbers and flights, the goal of limiting global heating cannot be achieved.""

XR adds: ""The UK aviation industry is aiming for growth beyond any conceived plan to reach UK net-zero emissions.

""Every flight piles more pressure on other industries to achieve further reductions, or on unproven technologies to save us in future.

""One of the greatest beneficial environmental impacts we can have as individuals is to reduce the number of flights we take.""

Twice-married Bradbrook, who has been repeatedly arrested by police at protests, revealed last month how on her Costa Rica break she took West African hallucinogenic shrub ibogaine. She claimed it ""rewired"" her brain, giving her ""the codes of social change"".

She added that she had undergone a ""mystical experience"" - explaining: ""I lay down and a voice that felt very external to me said, 'Gail, you create your own reality'.

""When I got home I ended a marriage and separated my family. It was a huge decision but it was the right thing to do.""

Bradbrook, a consultant who has two grown-up sons and lives in a council house in Stroud, Gloucs, added: ""I'd been focused on trying to start civil disobedience since 2010. I'd tried many things and they hadn't worked. So I went on a retreat and prayed, with some psychedelic medicines.

""It was really intense and I prayed for what I called the codes for social change and within a month my prayer was answered.""

Go home

XR blockades have caused widespread disruption in the capital since the campaign's birth, including shutting off five bridges.

In April protesters occupied high-profile London sites including Piccadilly Circus and Parliament Square, causing rush-hour misery for commuters. It led Metropolitan Police Commissioner Cressida Dick to call on campaigners to either ""protest lawfully go home"".

Ms Dick also added that officers who had been drafted in were usually dedicated instead to fighting knife crime or protecting children.

In the past week police forces from around the country have been called into action to help out the Met.

At the same time in the capital there have been several stabbings, including the death of a 15-year-old boy in Stratford, East London, on Thursday.

Sherlock actor Benedict Cumberbatch - who has taken part in car ads - joined XR activists at their makeshift campsite in central London on Tuesday, spending around two hours there. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn praised XR for ""educating us"".

Animal rights protesters claimed yesterday there had been ""mass arrests"" after they demonstrated at Billingsgate Fish Market in East London in the early hours.

Gail Bradbrook clocked up 11,000 air miles as she flew to Costa Rica for a week's £2,500 stay at the reat New Life Iboga retreat then a week touring the tropical paradise.

Last year the 47-year-old helped set up the XR climateprotest campaign which is a week into two weeks disruptions across London.

Thousands of protesters brought the capital to standstill last week as they blocked roads and bridges, forcing ambulances to be diverted and causing mayhem for motorists. Some protesters handcuffed themselves to cars or glued themselves to government buildings. Activists occupied London City Airport and militant vegan offshoot Animal Rebellion took over Smithfield Meat Market.

Spirit of the otter

Yesterday the activists caused more chaos in London - and the mayhem is set to continue this week.

The leftie XR group is calling for a reduction in air travel and wants the Government to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2025.

Yet Bradbrook, who has posted about the need to ground aircraft, proudly put pictures on Facebook during her 2016 Costa Rica jaunt - which left a carbon footprint of 2.6TONNES of CO2 emissions. One photo was of her in a flowery dress at the beach taking snaps of monkeys.

She revealed that her holiday of self-discovery included taking hallucinogenic drugs that inspired her calling ""to get with the spirit of the otter"".

And she said it was ""filled with nature and the warm sea"", cooing over lizards, iguanas, birds that ""nick your breakfast"" and monkeys that ""smash mangoes on the roofs"". She also gushed that she wanted to use her visit to ""express my most passionate self"" in ""the most filthiest, animal way"".

Bradbrook said she contacted a spirit known as Grandmother Ayahuasca and got a ""kick up the a*** on negative habits"".

Tory MP Paul Scully last night said of her jaunt: ""This is blind hypocrisy from a group that's spent days blighting people's travel plans.

""Just like their Corbynista backers, they say one thing and do another. And as we've seen already, they are more interested in creating a scene than offering solutions - all at taxpayers' expense. Only Boris Johnson and the Conservatives are taking world-leading action li t h W h on climate change. We have reduced emissions by a quarter since coming to office in 2010, the fastest reduction by any G20 nation, and boosted renewables to record levels.""

Up to 500 eco-zealots plan to blockade scores of dairy depots for the next two weeks to demand a switch to plant-based alternatives.

Last night, the boss of the UK's largest supplier of fresh milk warned it could lead to a nationwide shortage and rocketing prices.

Animal Rebellion - a rabble of students and woke volunteers - is behind the plan. It warned of its campaign: ""People are prepared to do whatever it non-violently takes - and that includes prison.""

Last month, it emptied milk over the floor of Harrods in London's Knightsbridge.

The average pinta price has already soared by 43 per cent to 59p in the past year amid the cost of living crisis.

Ash Amirahmadi, of dairy supplier Arla Foods UK, said: ""Anything that adds to the cost of business will end up adding to costs for customers. We are working with police and government to make sure it keeps being supplied.""

","THERE were six nailed-on certainties about the chief ""Just Stop Oil"" protester who caused London's critical M25 Dartford Crossing to be partially shut for the best part of two days by climbing up the Queen Elizabeth II Bridge above it.

First, he'd have a scraggly beard and a beany hat.

Second, he'd speak in hysterical, apocalyptic terms about the imminent end of the planet.

Third, he'd preach selfrighteously about wanting to save lives, while not giving a monkey's cuss about the possibility of his own actions costing lives.

Fourth, he'd vow not to quit his protest until the Government caved to his demands, then give up when it got a bit chilly.

Fifth, he'd laughably and offensively compare himself to civil rights campaigner Dr Martin Luther King Jr.

Sixth, the police would be powerless to do anything about him.

Morgan Trowland, a 39-yearold engineer from New Zealand, perfectly personifies the arrogance, delusion, selfishness and hypocritical cowardice of these eco-loon imbeciles who've become a daily blight on our lives.

He doesn't care how much chaos, disruption or misery he and his motley mob cause because, according to him, the world's about to end anyway.

'They make us want to do the opposite'

Yet rather than try to persuade people about the validity of his argument through democratic argument and discourse, he thinks he can do it by enraging everyone.

In recent weeks, Just Stop Oil have intensified their irritant antics - blocking roads, invading pitches at football matches and, in their most disgusting, shameful move, hurling human faeces over a statue for the late, great Captain Sir Tom Moore.

Last Friday, two young women hurled tomato soup at Van Gogh's masterpiece Sunflowers in the National Gallery.

Take the Animal Rebellion idiots who poured milk on to the floors of supermarkets and stores such as Harrods and Fortum & Mason as they demanded a ""plant-based future"".

Can you imagine a dumber optic than that in the middle of the worst cost-of-living crisis in living memory?

Is there a single person in Britain who would watch these sour-faced goons wasting ever more expensive milk like that, at a time when food bank queues are going through the roof, and conclude: ""I must join their fight!""

And that's before we get to their woeful disrespect for the store workers who have to then clean up their mess.

My own personal nadir for these loathsome losers came when they spray-painted the outside of an Aston Martin showroom.

As a proud, long-time Aston Martin owner, I share the view of former Top Gear star

Richard Hammond, who explained on Good Morning Britain that driving an old Aston for a few thousand miles a year produces less carbon footprint than the mobile phones or laptops these protesters use to tweet out their fury.

He also pointed out the main issue with their demands for an immediate move to electric cars: They're far too expensive for most people to be able to afford them.

If there's one thing more irksome than the chaos these louts are causing, it's the apparent impotence of the police to deal with them properly.

Former Home Secretary Suella Braverman named and blamed the culprits in Parliament yesterday when she said: ""It's the Labour Party, it's the Lib Dems ... it's the Guardianreading, tofu-eating wokerati ... that we have to thank for the disruption that we are seeing on our roads today.""

Despite losing her position yesterday, she was right to say opposition politicians have refused to back a crackdown on protests that block roads, and they must now do so before we see more members of the enraged public inevitably take the law into their own hands.

When Morgan Trowland climbed up the Queen Elizabeth II Bridge with his teacher mate Marcus, and lay comfortably in a hammock on Monday and Tuesday, he declared he would be staying there until the Government quit oil for renewables, ""funded by the fossil fuel companies, and the rich"".

But he quit after just 36 hours and won precisely zero concessions from the Government. To say that Morgan Trowland is no Dr King is like saying Kim Kardashian is no Einstein.

He boasted they had ""successfully disrupted oil supplies to Kent and the South East"".

But that wasn't all they'd disrupted, was it?

'His idea of sacrifice is lying in hammock' They'd also stopped tens of thousands of people from going to work, including nurses, doctors, police and fire officers, teachers.

Who knows how many lives they risked? They don't know, and they don't care.

And there lies the conceit at the heart of this Just Stop Oil campaign.

They pretend they're about ""safeguarding human life"" but constantly put lives in danger through their behaviour.

""Martin Luther King was reviled in America in the early 1960s,"" said Trowland. ""Sometimes people hate the thing that needs to come next.""

Comparing himself to one of the bravest, most heroic and peace-loving campaigners in history is pathetically inappropriate from a guy whose idea of sacrifice is lying in a hammock.

And it's not the thing that needs to come next that we all hate, it's his Just Stop Oil methodology.

The worst thing about his behaviour is that, like many, I believe climate change is real, and I do think we should be doing more to combat it.

But you can't do that by ditching fossil fuels overnight for green energy because that simply isn't workable, either practically or financially.

The sensible way forward is to phase out our reliance on fossil fuels at the same speed we can produce efficient, plentiful and, crucially, affordable green energy to replace it.

I think most people would sign up to that.

Animal Rebellion: 250 arrests

The group has seen 700 arrests in the past six months, and since 2019 the clean-up bill for its campaigns has cost the Metropolitan Police £60million.

During one week this April it cost the police £10million to deal with public demonstrations, with 16,000 officers needed to oversee London demos against fossil fuels plus nearly £2million in overtime payments.

Demonstrations by six core groups - Extinction Rebellion, Just Stop Oil, Animal Rebellion, Insulate Britain, Scientist Rebellion and Tyre Extinguishers - have led to 3,000 arrests in the past six months and millions of pounds in policing costs.

MP Iain Duncan Smith last night slammed the activists, saying: ""I don't just believe they are putting lives at risk - they have put lives at risk.

""The law has to be much, much tighter. There needs to be severe punishments. They masquerade under the illusion they are going to stop climate change when the reality is they are ruining lives.

Just Stop Oil boasts about its lack of convictions and members say arrests encourage them to continue.

In the past six months the group has demonstrated almost every day, resulting in 1,900 arrests.

Incidents have included blocking roads and bridges, preventing ambulances from reaching hospitals, vandalising shops, gluing themselves to roads and throwing soup over Van Gogh's Sunflowers painting.

The group - which blocked roads yesterday across four London locations and was also accused of having ""blood on its hands"" after the deaths of two women on a hard shoulder because of one of their protests - has demonstrated almost every day over the past six months.

Animal Rebellion, which campaigns for animal and climate justice, has held at least 16 protests in the past six months, leading to 250 arrests for crimes such as stealing milk and criminal damage.

While the right to protest is rightly protected, some of these stunts have gone well beyond the law and are costing huge sums.

107,The Times (London),Broadsheet,2019,"Meat is off the menu as hi-tech rivals thrive; New plant-based substitutes for animal protein will be much cheaper, healthier and greener","My German friend opened a small bottle. ""Sniff that."" The scent of newly cooked sausages filled my nostrils. ""We can make the smell,"" he said. ""But we can't do the taste. Yet."" That was 1984, in the offices of Melchers & Co, a Bremen-based trading house with decades of experience in essential oils and flavourings. The prospect gripped me. For 35 years I have dutifully tried every vegetarian substitute for meat. Fibrous lentil burgers, tasteless tofu and rubbery Quorn (made from fungus) all failed to grab me. Vegetarian food is delicious. But not when it is pretending to be meat.

Last month in Washington my taste buds finally caught up with my nose. I was in Kramerbooks, the American capital's bookshop-cumbar-cum-café, which serves the new Impossible Burger - a meat-like patty made mainly from soya, wheat and potato proteins, coconut fat and yeast-based flavouring. This looked, smelled and tasted like meat: crispy on the outside, succulent without being greasy, chewy but not gristly. The sizzle in the kitchen was authentic too. All five senses were satisfied. So was my wallet: at $14 it cost the same as a posh burger made from wagyu beef. Most importantly, it cleared my conscience. Eating animals is not just mildly unhealthy. It is bad for the environment. Most rearing practices (even leaving aside slaughter) involve stress and harm - lots of it in the cases of pigs and chickens. The main reason for eating meat is selfish pleasure: it tastes nice.

The Impossible Burger removes that argument. When the company starts selling in this country, I can't see why I would want to buy any processed meat product ever again. When the next generation of products arrive - reproducing the texture of steak and chicken breast - my meat-eating days will be largely over.

So too, soon, will the meat industry. The new foods are produced in factories, which are inherently cheaper and more efficient than animal husbandry.

Industrial meat production - factory farming - has already reached the limit of its efficiency: making the products cheaper involves horrible trade-offs involving cruelty, abuse of antibiotics and pollution.

Impossible Foods is just beginning to sell its products, and only in the United States and Hong Kong. Having started in restaurants (chiefly Burger King), it has just begun retail grocery sales, priced at the very top end of the market - the equivalent of $12 per pound, or about £21 per kilo. But consumer interest is startling. Since its debut in Los Angeles on September 20, in the Gelson's Markets chain, the plantmade mince has been the bestselling packaged item, outselling its beef rivals in both volume and revenue. Customers are subject to an un-American 10-pack limit.

Other companies are hurtling into the market too. The food giant Kelloggs is launching a product called Incogmeato. The share price of Beyond Meat, backed by Bill Gates, has risen six-fold since it went public in May. It is launching a ""PLT"" burger (made with pea protein) via McDonald's in Canada. Future products will be tastier, cheaper and more varied. The new wares have barely started reaping the rewards of mass production, specialisation and further innovation, such as precision fermentation. Next up will be animal protein cells grown in labs - shrimp is a likely early contender. The conclusion is inescapable. As prices fall, quality rises and availability increases, food technology will do for cows (soon) and other animals (later) what the mechanisation of transport did for horses.

A new study by RethinkX, a think tank, forecasts that plant-based competitors will be five times cheaper than animal proteins by 2030, with more price falls after that. They will eventually cost the same as sugar. By 2030 the quantity of beef mince consumed in the US will have shrunk by 70 per cent, and the steak market by 30 per cent. The number of cows will be halved. The dairy industry will be bankrupt: the flavour and protein content of milk will soon be reproduced with biotechnology; the value of agricultural land will plummet.

But doom for farm animals and the industry that depends on them will be matched by joy for the planet. Making an Impossible Burger, the company reckons, consumes a twentieth of the land, a quarter of the water and less than a twelfth of the fertiliser required by its dead-cow counterpart, while emitting only an eighth of the greenhouse gases. The RethinkX study forecasts that 60 per cent of American farmland will be available for other uses, such as reforestation. That could fully offset US greenhouse gas emissions by 2035.

The paradox here is that the heroes of the story are science and capitalism - normally seen by the green-minded as the arch-villains. The Impossible Burger's success stems from genetically engineering strains of yeast to make the ""heme"" protein. This adds the sought-after meaty taste that has eluded its rivals. It is the financial markets that signal and chase the potential rewards, providing the nearly $700 million raised by Impossible Foods alone. It is competition in the retail and restaurant sector that brings the new foodstuffs to consumers. In the end the big food giants' muscle (after they buy some of the upstarts) will be what turns niche products into mass-market ones. The militant vegans of Animal Rebellion aim to disrupt London for two weeks, starting today, under the slogan ""Kill capitalism not animals"". They are ordering from the wrong menu.

Advances will do for cows what mechanised transport did for horses",Right-Center ,0,927,"Meat is off the menu as hi-tech rivals thrive; New plant-based substitutes for animal protein will be much cheaper, healthier and greenerMy German friend opened a small bottle. ""Sniff that."" The scent of newly cooked sausages filled my nostrils. ""We can make the smell,"" he said. ""But we can't do the taste. Yet."" That was 1984, in the offices of Melchers & Co, a Bremen-based trading house with decades of experience in essential oils and flavourings. The prospect gripped me. For 35 years I have dutifully tried every vegetarian substitute for meat. Fibrous lentil burgers, tasteless tofu and rubbery Quorn (made from fungus) all failed to grab me. Vegetarian food is delicious. But not when it is pretending to be meat.

Last month in Washington my taste buds finally caught up with my nose. I was in Kramerbooks, the American capital's bookshop-cumbar-cum-café, which serves the new Impossible Burger - a meat-like patty made mainly from soya, wheat and potato proteins, coconut fat and yeast-based flavouring. This looked, smelled and tasted like meat: crispy on the outside, succulent without being greasy, chewy but not gristly. The sizzle in the kitchen was authentic too. All five senses were satisfied. So was my wallet: at $14 it cost the same as a posh burger made from wagyu beef. Most importantly, it cleared my conscience. Eating animals is not just mildly unhealthy. It is bad for the environment. Most rearing practices (even leaving aside slaughter) involve stress and harm - lots of it in the cases of pigs and chickens. The main reason for eating meat is selfish pleasure: it tastes nice.

The Impossible Burger removes that argument. When the company starts selling in this country, I can't see why I would want to buy any processed meat product ever again. When the next generation of products arrive - reproducing the texture of steak and chicken breast - my meat-eating days will be largely over.

So too, soon, will the meat industry. The new foods are produced in factories, which are inherently cheaper and more efficient than animal husbandry.

Industrial meat production - factory farming - has already reached the limit of its efficiency: making the products cheaper involves horrible trade-offs involving cruelty, abuse of antibiotics and pollution.

Impossible Foods is just beginning to sell its products, and only in the United States and Hong Kong. Having started in restaurants (chiefly Burger King), it has just begun retail grocery sales, priced at the very top end of the market - the equivalent of $12 per pound, or about £21 per kilo. But consumer interest is startling. Since its debut in Los Angeles on September 20, in the Gelson's Markets chain, the plantmade mince has been the bestselling packaged item, outselling its beef rivals in both volume and revenue. Customers are subject to an un-American 10-pack limit.

Other companies are hurtling into the market too. The food giant Kelloggs is launching a product called Incogmeato. The share price of Beyond Meat, backed by Bill Gates, has risen six-fold since it went public in May. It is launching a ""PLT"" burger (made with pea protein) via McDonald's in Canada. Future products will be tastier, cheaper and more varied. The new wares have barely started reaping the rewards of mass production, specialisation and further innovation, such as precision fermentation. Next up will be animal protein cells grown in labs - shrimp is a likely early contender. The conclusion is inescapable.

108,The Times (London),Broadsheet,2019,Feeling the warmth as gifts flow in,"Climate change activists were greeted by members of the public bearing food and warm clothing on the second day of their protest (Tom Ball writes).

Sympathisers responded to requests for supplies from the organisers after the police had confiscated much of the group's camping equipment.

Marie Vasquez, 53, stayed up late on Monday night cooking several batches of vegan lasagne and delivered them with the help of a neighbour on Tuesday morning.

""I agree with what they are saying but I hadn't intended to come down and protest - that isn't really my thing,"" Ms Vasquez, from south London, said. ""Then when I saw the pictures and the video clips of people in the streets standing up for what they believe in, I thought, 'You know what, it's about time I did my bit too.'

""I raided my attic and found a load of old clothes - jumpers, shirts, tracksuit bottoms - which I thought might come in handy for them,"" he said. ""We had a few pots and pans too, which I convinced my housemate to donate for a good cause.""

David Kelly, 52, an Extinction Rebellion steward, said that the police had tried to cut the group's supply lines by impounding vans hired by protesters to bring in equipment for building stages, kitchens and portable lavatories.

Demonstrators in Trafalgar Square took the afternoon's heavy rain in their stride, and danced to Singin' in the Rain, which was broadcast via solar-powered speakers.

Dance classes had been held beneath Nelson's Column earlier, and one elderly onlooker, who had come for the day, said: ""Never in all my years did I think I'd see this. It's fantastic.""

Outside the Home Office, police officers spent almost an hour trying to free a man who had cemented his arm to the ground. He was arrested to the cheers of fellow protesters.

At Smithfield Market some meat traders expressed their solidarity with the vegan occupiers who turned it into a fruit and vegetable market. More than 100 members of Animal Rebellion, an offshoot of Extinction Rebellion, set up camp there to share their ""vision of a future plant-based food system"".

Steven Hall, 38, a meat trader whose father and grandfather both worked at Smithfield, said that although he was not a vegan he agreed with their protest. ""To be honest, I think good on them,"" said Mr Hall, from Bracknell, Berkshire, who has worked at the market for 18 years. ""I've got two kids myself and I want the world to be safe for them in the future. Most of us here agree that things need to change. We aren't denying that.""

Others, however, were less tranquil about the sit-in. A trader working for James Burden, a wholesaler, said that missing one day of trade would collectively cost the 31 meat companies millions of pounds.

""It's a joke,"" the trader, who did not want to be named, said.

""Vehicles can't get in to collect the meat and it means we can't serve as many of our customers. It will cost our business alone £10,000 in one night.""

A protester who spent the night in Smithfield Market had flown in from the US and accepted that he could be accused of hypocrisy for having such a big carbon footprint. James Hoot, 27, a vegan documentary maker from Maryland, joined the Animal Rebellion demonstrators and will be travelling to 15 other countries to make a series of films about veganism.

110,The Times (London),Broadsheet,2019,Climate activists to use Bruce Lee tactics against bankers and judges,"Extinction Rebellion will target bankers in its second week of protests after thousands of reinforcements arrived over the weekend to give the group a second wind.

From 7am today activists will descend on the City to try to block roads and hit public transport. Organisers hope to cause maximum disruption to financial institutions, including the Bank of England. ""The sector's contribution to funding climate breakdown is driving us towards ecological collapse,"" a spokesman said. Activists will also target the Royal Courts of Justice, where they plan to cause disorder from midday.

Despite a robust police response, which has shut down nearly all of the group's original sites around the capital with the exception of Trafalgar Square, Extinction Rebellion's numbers are believed to have swelled over the week-end by 30,000.Training sessions were held yesterday at the rebel encampment in Vauxhall Pleasure Gardens to get those newly arrived up to speed in the art of protest. From 10am to 6pm, classes on ""De-escalation"", ""Considering arrest"", ""Know your rights"" and ""Witnessing arrest"" were on offer.

The targeting of new sites reflects the group's adoption of tactics used in the Hong Kong protests. Organisers say that the group is following the mantra of ""be water"", which emerged from the anti-government demonstrations. The phrase, which was coined by Bruce Lee, the actor and martial arts expert, refers to a strategy of flexibility and spreading themselves more widely.

Rob Small, 25, one of the activists, told The Times that the use of ""flash mobs"" to target specific locations made the group more unpredictable and effective. ""The demonstrations in Hong Kong are of course a big influence for us and we have looked at what they do there and learnt from their example,"" he said.

On Saturday morning, protesters from Extinction Rebellion's offshoot Animal Rebellion blockaded Billingsgate fish market in east London. Activists later shut down Oxford Street, as well as roads around Euston station and Russell Square, for several hours. On Sunday afternoon about 100 people amassed outside Scotland Yard.

A section 14 order, imposed by police on Tuesday, bans demonstrations in every part of London with the exception of Trafalgar Square. By 4pm yesterday there had been 1,309 arrests, according to police.

A Mail on Sunday article highlighted the fact that the group pays some of its activists up to £400 a week. The paper said Tamsin Omond, the granddaughter of a baronet, was among those who received payments, which have totalled more than £70,000 in four months.

The group said: ""We understand this to be an attempt to shame them for asking for the basic funds to live and support themselves as they contribute their time to build this movement. It is no secret that people claim expenses within Extinction Rebellion. These expenses allow people who commit themselves to Extinction Rebellion to do so in a sustainable way, without being depleted financially, plus also ensuring it is not just those in more comfortable financial situations who can contribute.""",Right-Center ,0,496,"Climate activists to use Bruce Lee tactics against bankers and judgesExtinction Rebellion will target bankers in its second week of protests after thousands of reinforcements arrived over the weekend to give the group a second wind.

The entrance to the works, which print titles including The Times, The Daily Telegraph, Daily Mail, The Sun and London's Evening Standard, were blocked in September. Boris Johnson called it an attack on free press.

At the opening of the case at St Albans magistrates' court, Liam Norton, 36, put on a pink eyemask and filmed on his iPhone while shouting: ""What is going on here is complete corruption.""

When asked to put the phone down he replied that it was glued to his hand and that his other hand had been stuck to benches being used as the dock.

District Judge Sally Fudge had just taken her seat when Norton began: ""I would like to make clear what is going on in this court is obvious and complete criminality. Judge, what you are doing is illegal."" He added: ""What we have seen over decades is organised criminality in this country and unfortunately the only thing to do, as I have showed, is contempt, as you have.""

He said: ""Society is on the brink of collapse and the Crown Prosecution Service continues to criminalise protests. Corruption is flowing through the highest levels of our system, yet our system continues to criminalise us.""

Norton held up proceedings by two hours. He was eventually freed and taken from the court. A Hertfordshire police spokesman said that a man ""was arrested for criminal damage and has been taken into custody"".

114,The Times (London),Broadsheet,2021,McDonald's burger factory hit by protests,"Animal rights protesters blockaded a food production centre that they claim produces three million beef patties a day for McDonald's.

Activists from the group Animal Rebellion say their aim is to cause ""massive disruption"" to the fast food giant's supply chain. The group wants McDonald's to switch to a fully plant-based menu within four years.

About 100 protesters held banners with slogans such as ""Meat and dairy = climate crisis"" at the OSI Food Solutions plant in Scunthorpe, Lincolnshire. A van, modified to look like a burger container, was painted with the slogan ""McMurder"".

The group is calling on more people to take tents and join the protest, which began in the early hours yesterday. The blockade comes after it shut down four McDonald's distribution centres two months ago, leading to shortages and store closures.

Animal Rebellion said it would end the blockade if McDonald's commits to becoming 20 per cent plant-based within a year.

Rose Patterson, a spokeswoman for the group, said: ""We're living in a time where massive change is possible, but our window to act on the climate crisis is closing quickly.

Demonstrators waved flares and held signs that read ""royal blood bath"" during the stunt, which they said was a protest against the use of Crown land for hunting. One of the protesters was carried away by Metropolitan Police officers who waded into the water at the Victoria Memorial, which sits directly in front of the palace in central London.

Scotland Yard said the number of arrests during demonstrations by Extinction Rebellion (XR) in London in the past week was nearing 300.

Kit Malthouse, the policing minister, told protesters that they were diverting resources away from fighting crime. He was responding to a video on social media that appeared to show a group of XR supporters pretending to arrest a cabbage in the street. ""Please go back to your homes and jobs #Extinction- Rebellion and let all those cops get back to fighting crime,"" he wrote on Twitter.

XR yesterday responded to claims that their previous mass protest in 2019 produced 120 tonnes of rubbish in the capital. The Conservative MP Nickie Aiken said: ""I was told by the council that last time Extinction Rebellion were here for two weeks, they cleared 120 tons of rubbish left behind. That added £50,000 to their costs. This is local people's council tax.""

An XR spokesman said there was ""no additional money spent by the council and no additional cost to the taxpayer"". He said XR was ""scrupulous about clearing up after ourselves"" and pointed out that London's 2016 new year celebrations produced ""85 tonnes of rubbish from just one night"".

The protest at the Victoria Memorial yesterday was organised by the campaign group Animal Rebellion, which is taking part in XR's planned two weeks of demonstrations in London. The group said it dyed the fountains ""blood red in a protest against use of Crown land for hunting and animal agriculture"". Harley McDonald-Eckersall, who represents the group, said: ""We are demanding that the Queen end the use of Crown land for industries which are contributing to the climate and ecological emergency and the death of animals.""

Scotland Yard said seven people had been arrested yesterday as of 5.45pm, bringing the total number of XR-related arrests since Sunday to 289.

At least 10,000 people have gathered at XR's Impossible Rebellion protests since they began in earnest on Monday. The group is demanding that the government immediately ends investment in fossil fuels that are driving climate change.

On Sunday, three protesters scaled the entrance to the Guildhall in central London, sprayed red paint over the walls of the building and unfurled a banner reading ""co-liberation freedom together"". XR kicked off its mass protest the next day, blocking roads including those around Trafalgar Square and setting up a large pink table near Covent Garden.

Protesters have also gathered outside the offices of HM Revenue & Customs and the Department of International Trade, as well as the Brazilian embassy. Next week, XR activists are expected to shift their focus to the City of London.

Police made a number of arrests after the climate change activists parked their open-top single-decker across a junction at the south end of the bridge. Officers could be seen using batons and dragging protesters from the top of the vehicle.

Other protesters caused disruption on Tower Bridge for the second day running by sitting on top of a caravan. The entrance to Downing Street was also blocked off by people pushing white prams with a banner that said: ""Climate change is killing children.""

The group gathered at a site near the Bank of England, turning several roads around the building into a ""giant play area"" for children and families.

Elsewhere, XR protesters targeted the headquarters of the WWF in Woking, saying that the nature charity could not ""continue to perpetuate colonial conservation methods that force indigenous people from their homes"".

It tweeted: ""It is very clear that the demo near London Bridge was an attempt to cause a major disruption to one of London's busiest bridges.

117,The Times (London),Broadsheet,2022,Vegans hold Mall protest over use of royal land,"Vegan activists vaulted fences near Buckingham Palace during Trooping the Colour before being tackled by police.

Protesters from the Animal Rebellion campaign carrying banners that read ""Reclaim royal land"" got on to The Mall despite a large security operation. Some laid down in the path of a military band shortly after 10am before being removed by police. One of the protesters wore a golden crown around a hat.

Despite the disturbance, the band marched on and continued with the parade. The group tweeted: ""Animal Rebels disrupt the Queen's Platinum Jubilee celebrations demanding that Royal Land is Reclaimed. This summer, we're taking bigger action against the dairy industry than ever before, and we need you.""

The group suggested other jubilee weekend events could be targeted.

Beau King Houston, one of the protesters, said: ""The royal family has had decades to lead the way on a just transition to plant-based farming and has failed to do so. This transition is common sense and simple. We all win.""

He claimed that 76 per cent of farmed land could be ""rewilded"" to absorb carbon from the atmosphere and ""spare billions of animals"". The Crown Estate is one of the UK's largest landowners.

The Metropolitan Police said later that officers made 12 arrests for obstruction of the highway.

118,The Times (London),Broadsheet,2022,Activists in the picture will be death of art; Everything from Stubbs's horses to The Kiss is in danger now protesters have succeeded in wiping out Hirst's flies,"Zap. That was the sound of Damien Hirst's installation A Hundred Years being consigned to the electric fly killer.

On Friday The Times reported that Hirst's work - a sculpture consisting of two glass chambers: one containing a box of maggots that hatch into flies, the other an electrocuting lamp - had been removed from display at Kunstmuseum Wolfsburg in Germany after protests by People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (Peta) and the city's veterinary office. ""Killing animals has nothing to do with art,"" said Peta. ""It just shows the arrogance of people who literally will stop at nothing for their own interests.""

Artnet, an online marketplace for auctions and galleries, has estimated that in the course of his artistic career Hirst has killed roughly one million creatures, 912,005 of them insects and butterflies. The most famous is the shark in formaldehyde. (Two sharks, in fact. The first, caught off the coast of Queensland, started to deteriorate and had to be replaced in 2006.) I hold no torch, nor LED zap-lamp, for the enfant horrible of British art, but whenever I read of a work of art being cancelled, hustled off into storage or otherwise boxed in to protect sensibilities, I think: slippery slope, thin end of the culture-wars wedge.

Let animal rights activists loose in a gallery and just see what else they might find. Nasty Carel Fabritius with his blameless goldfinch chained to a perch in the Mauritshuis, in The Hague. The Goldfinch is the gallery's second most famous painting after Vermeer's Girl With a Pearl Earring. Did anyone ask the oyster if it minded giving up the pearl? What about Vermeer's The Milkmaid in the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam? A blatant celebration of the dairy industry at a time when we should all be switching to plant-based mylks.

Then there's the tradition of chase paintings such as The Hunt of the Unicorn tapestries in the Met Cloisters, New York. The unicorn is pursued, captured, surrounded by hounds, subdued with spears, then killed with numerous strikes as the dogs take chunks from its flesh. Unicorns may or may not exist, but hunters through the ages have done the same to stags. The Pitt Rivers Museum in Oxford took its shrunken heads out of view. Will the Ashmolean Museum do the same with Paolo Uccello's The Hunt in the Forest with its tally-ho riders, beaters and greyhounds in search of their quarry?

Peta doesn't approve of riding horses, full stop. In an article on its website, ""Say 'neigh' to horse-riding"", Peta points out that horses ""can't consent to being ridden by people - and if they could, they'd likely ask folks to hop off their backs"". Better to ""ride a skateboard or a bike - not someone who lives, breathes, and feels"". So that's that for Van Dyck's Charles I on Horseback, Jacques- Louis David's Napoleon Crossing the Alps and all equestrian monuments from Marcus Aurelius onwards.

Horse-racing, too, is fraught. Last month, Surrey police arrested six women from the campaign group Animal Rebellion when they delayed the Epsom Derby by throwing themselves on to the turf. The protesters wore suffragette-style sashes with the message ""Animal justice"". One of the Epsom Six put out a statement saying: ""Horseracing took the lives of 220 animals on racecourses in the UK last year and this is just the tip of the iceberg."" So that's that for George Stubbs, his horses, trainers and riders.

Whistlejacket might survive the cull, painted as nature intended without bit or bridle or reins.

The statement also drew attention to the ""billion"" land animals killed for food in the UK each year (estimates differ). ""Exploitation of, and violence against, animals is fuelling the climate emergency and suffering across the globe. It is obvious we must choose life over death and stop animal exploitation."" Off to the basement chiller cabinet, then, with Rembrandt's Flayed Ox, Chardin's hanging pheasants and all those Dutch still-lifes with their headless herrings, crabs, lobsters and hunks of gouda cheese.

Student activists have already successfully campaigned to have meat removed from some college canteen menus. And don't even get them started on ivory Madonnas and chess sets.

Every special interest group could have their say. Incels - militant young men identifying as involuntary celibates - could pour cold water on the lovers in Rodin's The Kiss and demand the removal of all those unattainable museum Aphrodites (""Stacys"") and Apollos (""Chads""). Stop the War protesters could camp out in front of the Battle of San Romano (Uccello again) and portraits of distinguished generals and dashing captains.

Paintings are sitting ducks, plucked or otherwise. We've seen in the last few weeks how easy it is for protesters to glue themselves to Van Gogh frames and cover Constables with double-sided sticky tape. I'd hate to see gallery security become more severe, but when the Hollywood actress Demi Moore can smuggle her chihuahua puppy Pilaf into the Louvre as she did last week, I do wonder what the guards and scanners are for.

You may reasonably say ""reductio ad absurdum"" and ""it'll never come to pass"". But we have been remarkably passive, even supine, when Extinction Rebellion has brought cities and motorways to a standstill. I think of myself as a doughty resister, but it's funny how ""good"" groupthink gets under your skin. Standing in front of Edwin Landseer's The Otter Speared in the Laing Art Gallery in Newcastle upon Tyne earlier this month, I thought: poor otter, dear Tarka, didn't stand a chance.

Still, I say to curators: resist. Resist the calls to cover up, to exile works because the artist wasn't very nice or the vegans wouldn't like it or someone somewhere might one day take offence. Art is a tapestry. Start pulling out threads because you don't like the warp or the weft and the whole picture unravels. Context, culture, creativity gone just like that. Zap. Alice Thomson is away

Artnet, an online marketplace for auctions and galleries, has estimated that in the course of his artistic career Hirst has killed roughly one million creatures, 912,005 of them insects and butterflies. The most famous is the shark in formaldehyde. (Two sharks, in fact. The first, caught off the coast of Queensland, started to deteriorate and had to be replaced in 2006.) I hold no torch, nor LED zap-lamp, for the enfant horrible of British art, but whenever I read of a work of art being cancelled, hustled off into storage or otherwise boxed in to protect sensibilities, I think: slippery slope, thin end of the culture-wars wedge.

Let animal rights activists loose in a gallery and just see what else they might find. Nasty Carel Fabritius with his blameless goldfinch chained to a perch in the Mauritshuis, in The Hague. The Goldfinch is the gallery's second most famous painting after Vermeer's Girl With a Pearl Earring. Did anyone ask the oyster if it minded giving up the pearl? What about Vermeer's The Milkmaid in the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam? A blatant celebration of the dairy industry at a time when we should all be switching to plant-based mylks.

Then there's the tradition of chase paintings such as The Hunt of the Unicorn tapestries in the Met Cloisters, New York. The unicorn is pursued, captured, surrounded by hounds, subdued with spears, then killed with numerous strikes as the dogs take chunks from its flesh. Unicorns may or may not exist, but hunters through the ages have done the same to stags. The Pitt Rivers Museum in Oxford took its shrunken heads out of view. Will the Ashmolean Museum do the same with Paolo Uccello's The Hunt in the Forest with its tally-ho riders, beaters and greyhounds in search of their quarry?

Peta doesn't approve of riding horses, full stop. In an article on its website, ""Say 'neigh' to horse-riding"", Peta points out that horses ""can't consent to being ridden by people - and if they could, they'd likely ask folks to hop off their backs"". Better to ""ride a skateboard or a bike - not someone who lives, breathes, and feels"". So that's that for Van Dyck's Charles I on Horseback, Jacques- Louis David's Napoleon Crossing the Alps and all equestrian monuments from Marcus Aurelius onwards.

Horse-racing, too, is fraught. Last month, Surrey police arrested six women from the campaign group Animal Rebellion when they delayed the Epsom Derby by throwing themselves on to the turf. The protesters wore suffragette-style sashes with the message ""Animal justice"". One of the Epsom Six put out a statement saying: ""Horseracing took the lives of 220 animals on racecourses in the UK last year and this is just the tip of the iceberg."" So that's that for George Stubbs, his horses, trainers and riders.

Whistlejacket might survive the cull, painted as nature intended without bit or bridle or reins.

The statement also drew attention to the ""billion"" land animals killed for food in the UK each year (estimates differ). ""Exploitation of, and violence against, animals is fuelling the climate emergency and suffering across the globe. It is obvious we must choose life over death and stop animal exploitation."" Off to the basement chiller cabinet, then, with Rembrandt's Flayed Ox, Chardin's hanging pheasants and all those Dutch still-lifes with their headless herrings, crabs, lobsters and hunks of gouda cheese.

Student activists have already successfully campaigned to have meat removed from some college canteen menus. And don't even get them started on ivory Madonnas and chess sets.

Every special interest group could have their say. Incels - militant young men identifying as involuntary celibates - could pour cold water on the lovers in Rodin's The Kiss and demand the removal of all those unattainable museum Aphrodites (""Stacys"") and Apollos (""Chads""). Stop the War protesters could camp out in front of the Battle of San Romano (Uccello again) and portraits of distinguished generals and dashing captains.

Paintings are sitting ducks, plucked or otherwise. We've seen in the last few weeks how easy it is for protesters to glue themselves to Van Gogh frames and cover Constables with double-sided sticky tape. I'd hate to see gallery security become more severe, but when the Hollywood actress Demi Moore can smuggle her chihuahua puppy Pilaf into the Louvre as she did last week, I do wonder what the guards and scanners are for.

You may reasonably say ""reductio ad absurdum"" and ""it'll never come to pass"". But we have been remarkably passive, even supine, when Extinction Rebellion has brought cities and motorways to a standstill. I think of myself as a doughty resister, but it's funny how ""good"" groupthink gets under your skin. Standing in front of Edwin Landseer's The Otter Speared in the Laing Art Gallery in Newcastle upon Tyne earlier this month, I thought: poor otter, dear Tarka, didn't stand a chance.

Still, I say to curators: resist. Resist the calls to cover up, to exile works because the artist wasn't very nice or the vegans wouldn't like it or someone somewhere might one day take offence. Art is a tapestry. Start pulling out threads because you don't like the warp or the weft and the whole picture unravels. Context, culture, creativity gone just like that. Zap. Alice Thomson is away

Vermeer's Milkmaid is a blatant celebration of the dairy industry"
119,The Times (London),Broadsheet,2022,Quest for food that doesn't cost the Earth,"Sometimes it really is worth paying attention to how sausages are made. If they include beef, for instance, they will be worse for the environment. If they include a lot of chicken, a study has estimated, they could be a lot better.

And if they are vegan then they are both better for the environment and better for you - at least, that is, when measured by a metric other than your taste buds.

Sausages were just one small part of a study that sought to assess the environmental impact of 57,000 different foods in the UK, and then compare it with the nutritional benefit.

The database is an attempt to catalogue the true costs of our food, so that consumers can make better decisions.

""There is a really big information gap right now,"" Dr Michael Clark, a researcher from Oxford University, said.

There are ad hoc schemes covering, for example, fairtrade bananas or sustainably caught fish. But there is no way to really judge one against the other: we cannot compare apples and oranges, let alone sea bass and bananas. ""We need to get to the point of being able to say, 'What's the actual impact of this product?' "" Clark said.

Working out the environmental impact of a foodstuff includes carbon footprint, water use and land use.

It is also based on the ingredients, and while bought food lists ingredients, producers rarely list quantities - considering that a trade secret.

However, in the UK it is mandatory to list ingredients in order of magnitude.

It is also mandatory to provide the exact percentages for some, for instance a beef lasagne will have to give the proportion of beef.

Using this information, as well as looking at those similar products for which the quantities of all ingredients are known, the new research, published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, created an algorithm that could provide a reasonable approximation where the proportions were unknown.

Clark said the method was obviously imperfect. ""We're dealing with unknown information. We don't know the composition of the products exactly.""

For legal reasons they cannot describe the information publicly for named branded products.

His hope is that supermarkets could improve it - for instance with voluntary labels using their data. Clark would also like consumers to integrate it into their overall approach. Because while the nutritional and environmental impact of a sausage is important, it is not the only factor.

""People have cultural preferences. They care about cost. And,"" he added, ""they care about taste.""

More than 40 activists from Animal Rebellion occupied offices of the RSPCA near Horsham, West Sussex, in protest at its policies on meat and dairy farming.

Members of Animal Rebellion tried to stop millions of people buying milk after they drilled through the tyres of lorries and filled pipes with expanding foam at facilities operated by the dairy companies Müller and Arla.

The off-shoot of Extinction Rebellion focuses on how the meat and dairy industry is contributing to climate change. It has vowed to disrupt dairy supplies this month as part of a campaign to force the government to move to a ""plant-based food system"" and rewild land used for animal pasture.

Wearing T-shirts that read ""put animal testing on trial"", the activists broke through a gate with an angle grinder and freed the dogs from cages.

Orla Coghlan, a representative of the group, told The Times that 18 dogs were taken to a ""safe house"" and were in a ""loving home"". Two other dogs were seized by police when two more members of the group were arrested.

The group of 14 gave themselves up to police and could receive up to ten years in prison if convicted of burglary. Cambridgeshire constabulary said that five people were arrested on suspicion of burglary and nine people on suspicion of aggravated trespass.

Beagles are raised at MBR Acres until they are 16 weeks old, then sold for animal testing, with about 2,000 being bred every year. Marshall BioResources holds a licence to destroy dogs in the facility and use their blood and organs.

Freedom of information requests have revealed that dogs at the breeding farm have suffered fly infestations, been housed in unhygienic buildings, had too little bedding, and suffered from a lack of outdoor space.

In June, activists from Animal Rebellion also took five beagles from the facility, but the Crown Prosecution Service dropped charges of burglary against them.

In response to the break-in yesterday, an official from Marshall BioResources said that ""this unlawful extreme action has placed stress on our animals and staff by totally disrupting our daily activity to take care for the welfare of our dogs on site.

She said that it had been illegal to use animals to test cosmetics and tobacco since the late 1990s, and that using animals to test household products was banned in 2010.

Jarrett added: ""These dogs are used for medical and veterinary safety testing.

MBR Acres is a fully licensed establishment and a lawful breeder of beagle dogs that are specially bred for human and animal research in an environment compliant with our licences.""

Wendy Jarrett of Understanding Animal Research, a not-for-profit company that represents groups involved in the use of animals for scientific investigation, said: ""It is illegal in the UK to use any animal in research if there is an alternative available.""

She said it had been illegal to use animals to test cosmetics and tobacco since the late 1990s, and that using animals to test household products was banned in 2010.

Jarrett added: ""These dogs are used for medical and veterinary safety testing. Since all new medicines must, by law, be tested on two species of mammal before being given to human volunteers in clinical trials, the theft of these dogs will have the knock-on effect of delaying or halting a clinical trial of a potential new medicine.""

Activists from Animal Rebellion broke into MBR Acres, a compound near Huntingdon in Cambridgeshire that is owned by Marshall BioResources, an American company that breeds animals for biomedical research, at 5.30am yesterday.

Wearing T-shirts that read ""put animal testing on trial"", the activists broke through a gate with an angle grinder and freed the dogs from cages.

Orla Coghlan, a representative of the group, told The Times that 18 dogs were taken to a ""safe house"" and were in a ""loving home"". Two other dogs were seized by police when two more members of the group were arrested.

The group of 14 gave themselves up to police and could receive up to ten years in prison if convicted of burglary. Cambridgeshire constabulary said that five people were arrested on suspicion of burglary and nine people on suspicion of aggravated trespass.

Beagles are raised at MBR Acres until they are 16 weeks old, then sold for animal testing, with about 2,000 being bred every year. Marshall BioResources holds a licence to destroy dogs in the facility and use their blood and organs. Freedom of Information requests revealed that dogs at the breeding farm have suffered fly infestations, been housed in unhygienic buildings, had too little bedding, and suffered from a lack of outdoor space.

127,The Daily Telegraph,Broadsheet,2019,Vegan activists to block historic meat market,"IT IS the largest wholesale meat market in Britain, and celebrated for selling some of the nation's finest cuts of beef, lamb and pork for more than 800 years.

But, if vegan activists have their way, London's Smithfield Market could be transformed into a parade of fruit and vegetable stalls without any animal produce in sight.

Inspired by the chaos caused by Extinction Rebellion, a new group plans to blockade the site for two weeks, leaving farmers and meat traders at risk of losing tens of thousands of pounds.

The campaigners, known as Animal Rebellion (AR), hope that up to 10,000 supporters will form a human wall of eco-warriors around Smithfield Market, in Farringdon, from Oct 7. They have been encouraged to bring pets along to ""reclaim"" the area and disrupt trade during opening hours from 2am-8am.

Tim Bonner, the chief executive of the Countryside Alliance, said the action would put the livelihoods of farmers and traders at risk and staff and customers are working with security and police to protect themselves.

He said: ""Their idea of a day out is to cause misery to others. They mask their politically driven agenda by pretending to care about animals. They are fuelled by hatred of people and those that opt for an alternative lifestyle to them.

""By targeting hard-working farmers and the market traders, they are risking people's livelihoods. They are ignorant of the facts around farming and that British farmers work to the highest ethical and environmental standards in the world.

""We sincerely hope plans are in place to protect the staff and customers at Smithfield Market, by working with security and police.""

AR have likened their efforts to shut down livestock farming and fishing to the struggles of Martin Luther King and the suffragettes.

Spokesman Alex Lockwood apologised in advance for any losses suffered by businesses, but he told The Sunday Telegraph: ""To be honest, if you know as much about the climate change science as I have looked into, then you know that we're all very likely to all lose our jobs if we don't act radically and immediately.

""Animal agriculture is one of the largest, if not the largest industry responsible for climate change emissions globally.""

The Smithfield Market tenants' association did not respond to a request for comment.

However, an independent trader said: ""If this goes ahead, with the sort of numbers they are talking about, the only thing it will achieve is stopping us from earning a living.

""It's bad enough with Extinction Rebellion blocking off all the roads, but this is going to take it to another level.""

This is, of course, a good point, but one can't help thinking they would be better off making it by refusing to fly to Los Angeles for work, or at least only doing it in a much more carbon efficient economy seat.

Back down on planet earth, where travel doesn't come with a flat bed and a wine list, normal people cannot stomach hypocrisy - mostly because they don't have much energy left for it after a week spent trying to get to work without a protester by jumping on top of their Tube train.

I write all of this with the greatest respect to Extinction Rebellion, as a journalist who is also a human who happens to be right behind them. I believe in what they believe in. But as any one of the actors and creatives who signed that letter will know, narrative is important. The stories we tell matter. They really matter. 

And you cannot preach truth while choosing to ignore the inconvenient truths about the way you live your own life (I borrow this phrase, of course, from the 2006 Al Gore film about global warming ). You cannot ask the government and the media to take you seriously, and then roll out a man dressed as a broccoli on national television.

Nor can you afford to be making dunderheaded strategic mistakes, such as disrupting public transport, as happened this week at Canning Town station. The hard-working people who take the Tube are just the sorts you want joining you in your fight, rather than turning against it. And you do not have to be a master strategist on the scale of Dominic Cummings to see that.

Extinction Rebellion want us to get real about the climate crisis, and yet they cannot seem to do this themselves. Their co-founder Clare Farrell defended the Tube protest, saying that ""the public, I don't think, realise quite how serious the situation is"". If that's true, and I really don't think it is, then there are a million better ways of spreading the message than glueing themselves to an electric train. 

Plus, all this reference to ""the public"" separates the group from the people they need most. Extinction Rebellion's aims are noble and important. It would be a great tragedy if, thanks to the naivety the group is currently displaying, they were to make themselves extinct."

Activists from Animal Rebellion, an Extinction Rebellion sister organisation, daubed red liquid over the Queen Victoria Memorial, turning the water crimson, and left red handprints on the 100-year-old white marble monument.

They claimed that they were protesting against the use of crown land for hunting and animal agriculture, and the red ""symbolises"" the Royal family's ""crimes against animals and our planet""

even though the monarchy has a long and proud tradition of promoting environmental issues.

Prince Charles made his most powerful intervention to date in the fight against climate change last week, telling business leaders they must help or the planet is ""done for"".

Protesters were pictured wading through the water in shoes while carrying placards that read ""A royal blood bath"". Some carried red flares. Police officers had to step into the water to try to remove them.

Harley McDonald-Eckersall, a spokesman for Animal Rebellion, said: ""The crown estate is the biggest landowner in the UK and they choose to use this land for animal agriculture and hunting, which not only decimate our environment but cause the deaths of millions of lives every year.

""It's time for a new system based on justice and compassion and the Royal family should be leading the way.

Crown land should be used to grow healthy, nutritious food for all and to provide homes for the animals we share this country with.

""We are demanding that the Queen end the use of crown land for industries which are contributing to the climate and ecological emergency and the death of animals.""

The 25-metre tall memorial is a monument to Queen Victoria located at the end of The Mall, that sits directly in front of Buckingham Palace. It was formally unveiled by King George V in 1911. The gates, piers, balustrades and retaining walls of the Memorial Gardens are all protected landmarks.

The Metropolitan Police said several of the activists involved in the protest had been arrested.

Members of the public visiting the palace were last night ordered to move away so forensic officers could photograph the large swathes of red smeared on the water feature. The vandalism comes after protesters blocked a busy road in Westminster yesterday afternoon, sitting on Victoria Street outside the Department of Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy.

They then erected a giant pink table in Oxford Circus, blocking traffic, to encourage world leaders to ""come to the table"" to engage with the issue of climate change. They also blocked the entrance to Selfridges in Oxford Street to demonstrate against clothes production, which they claim is damaging the environment.

139,The Daily Telegraph,Broadsheet,2021,"Why Brits have always prized pets above people; As the row over Kabul's cats and dogs makes headlines, Harry Mount unpicks a national obsession","It's a typically British response to one of the nation's greatest loves: our pets. We are some of the most obsessive - if not the most obsessive - animal-lovers in the world. Just yesterday was National Dog Day, an entire 24 hours devoted to our second most-hallowed pet, after cats.

So, it should probably be no surprise that one of the most left-field stories to come out of the desperate situation in Afghanistan this week, has been a row over cats and dogs.

Pen Farthing, a British citizen and former marine, refused to leave Kabul without his staff at Nowzad, the animal shelter he set up there, and the 200 pets it looks after.

Ben Wallace, the Defence Secretary, initially refused the request, with reports claiming he told a meeting of MPs: ""What I was not prepared to do is prioritise pets over people."" But Farthing refused to back down, becoming a thorn in the side of the Government during a growing humanitarian crisis. It's been alleged that Carrie Johnson, the Prime Minister's wife and animal rights enthusiast, stepped in, in the hope of getting them all on a plane (something Downing Street has denied). There have also been whispers in Westminster of MPs being inundated with letters from constituents concerned about the fate of Farthing's feline and canine charges.

The episode has brought into sharp focus a peculiarly British trait. So what is about our national character that often persuades us to put pets above people?

As a nation, we are the proud owners of nine million dogs and 10.7 million cats. That means 24 per cent of UK adults share their home with a moggy. And, according to a YouGov poll this year, four of our 15 most popular charities are animalrelated: Battersea Dogs and Cats Home (number six); the RSPCA (number seven); Guide Dogs (number 11); and the World Wildlife Fund (number 14). In 2019 alone, the RSPCA received £130.7million in donations. In 2015, more money was left in wills to the Donkey Sanctuary (£21million) than to the Royal British

Legion (£16million), which raises funds from poppy-sellers to help wounded and troubled veterans. That year, a woman named Heather Ilott successfully sued and won £164,000, after her late mother left her nothing and bequeathed nearly £500,000 to the RSPCA, Blue Cross and the RSPB.

And who can forget the tale of Blackie the donkey that dominated the headlines in 1987? The poor creature was doomed to carry the fattest man in a Spanish village during a festival that, the previous year, had seen the chosen animal die. A war broke out between tabloid newspapers to buy the donkey, with The Star beating The Sun, and bringing him to a donkey sanctuary in Devon - something presented as a triumph for British animal-lovers.

Our intense love of animals can be traced back to the Industrial Revolution. The huge migration of British workers from land to factory, and from country to city, starting in the 18th century, was the earliest in the world. And as the British agricultural economy turned industrial, and common land and smallholdings were increasingly enclosed for commercial purposes, our direct family connections with working animals broke down.

As we moved to towns, our dogs were no longer kept for herding sheep, nor our cats for keeping farmyard vermin at bay. We began to value them out of pure affection and pleasure. The RSPCA, the oldest and biggest animal welfare charity in the world, was founded in 1824.

Today, you can see a stark divide between animals kept for consumption and breeding - cows, sheep, pigs and chickens - and those pets kept for the sheer joy of it, principally cats and dogs. Even working dogs in the countryside - sheepdogs and hunting dogs - have become the close companions of their owners.

That deep affection between human and animal blossomed in the 19th century, not least in the portraits Queen Victoria and Prince Albert commissioned of their animals.

Again and again, the royal couple had their favoured pets and working animals painted. One of the most famous, Her Majesty's Favourite Pets was painted by the great artist, Edwin Landseer, in 1838, showing the Queen's spaniel Dash, Lory the parrot, Nero the greyhound and Hector the deerhound. You don't give animals names if you're about to kill and eat them; you do when they become quasihumans.

Not that the Animal Rebellion protestors who defaced the Queen Victoria

Memorial in London yesterday - dying its water red apparently in opposition to the royal family allowing hunting on its land - will have stopped for a second to consider that the fountain's namesake heralded the era of the beloved pet.

There is another peculiar aspect to the British character that explains our love of cats and dogs: our awkwardness with our fellow human beings. We just aren't all that good at (sober) conversation, particularly with the opposite sex. And one of the great things about animals is you don't have to talk to them, although plenty of owners do have a one-sided conversation with their pets.

That is also to do with the Industrial Revolution. Thanks to factory life, men and women were segregated during the working day, in a way that didn't happen in the peasant economies of southern Europe, where farming families tended to live and work together until well into the 20th century.

It made us that much richer, too. A pet is, after all, another mouth to feed. Only a wealthy country like Britain - the richest nation in the world during the 19th century - could afford to look upon animals as friends, rather than lunch.

Our climate helps. The weather - while not much fun during a washout summer - is accommodating to breeds of animals from all over the world. Not least Afghan hounds, which were originally from Afghanistan and found their way to Britain. You try keeping a cat at the North Pole or taking a labrador for a walk in the Sahara. But most breeds of dog and cat can flourish on our temperate islands.

It's the same climate that encouraged us to get outdoors and create new sports in the 18th and 19th centuries. That meant hunting and shooting, both with dogs. That love of blood sports morphed into our modern habit of walking with dogs, without a gun or the need for a fox to chase after.

At the end of Dr No, James Bond is in Jamaica, having conquered his arch-enemy. He is about to leap into a double sleeping bag with his latest knockout girlfriend, Honey Rider. What could be more agreeable? And yet, despite being in tropical paradise, Bond finds himself longing for ""the douce weather of England"".

Quoting from Lord Chesterfield's 18th-century letters, Bond praises England, ""the only country where you can take a walk every day of the year"". And, he might have added, the only country where you can take your beloved dog for a walk every day of the year. Just as we like it.

The episode has brought into sharp focus a peculiarly British trait. So what is about our national character that often persuades us to put pets above people?

As a nation, we are the proud owners of nine million dogs and 10.7 million cats. That means 24 per cent of UK adults share their home with a moggy. And, according to a YouGov poll this year, four of our 15 most popular charities are animalrelated: Battersea Dogs and Cats Home (number six); the RSPCA (number seven); Guide Dogs (number 11); and the World Wildlife Fund (number 14). In 2019 alone, the RSPCA received £130.7million in donations. In 2015, more money was left in wills to the Donkey Sanctuary (£21million) than to the Royal British

Legion (£16million), which raises funds from poppy-sellers to help wounded and troubled veterans. That year, a woman named Heather Ilott successfully sued and won £164,000, after her late mother left her nothing and bequeathed nearly £500,000 to the RSPCA, Blue Cross and the RSPB.

And who can forget the tale of Blackie the donkey that dominated the headlines in 1987? The poor creature was doomed to carry the fattest man in a Spanish village during a festival that, the previous year, had seen the chosen animal die. A war broke out between tabloid newspapers to buy the donkey, with The Star beating The Sun, and bringing him to a donkey sanctuary in Devon - something presented as a triumph for British animal-lovers.

Our intense love of animals can be traced back to the Industrial Revolution. The huge migration of British workers from land to factory, and from country to city, starting in the 18th century, was the earliest in the world. And as the British agricultural economy turned industrial, and common land and smallholdings were increasingly enclosed for commercial purposes, our direct family connections with working animals broke down.

As we moved to towns, our dogs were no longer kept for herding sheep, nor our cats for keeping farmyard vermin at bay. We began to value them out of pure affection and pleasure. The RSPCA, the oldest and biggest animal welfare charity in the world, was founded in 1824.

Today, you can see a stark divide between animals kept for consumption and breeding - cows, sheep, pigs and chickens - and those pets kept for the sheer joy of it, principally cats and dogs. Even working dogs in the countryside - sheepdogs and hunting dogs - have become the close companions of their owners.

That deep affection between human and animal blossomed in the 19th century, not least in the portraits Queen Victoria and Prince Albert commissioned of their animals.

Again and again, the royal couple had their favoured pets and working animals painted. One of the most famous, Her Majesty's Favourite Pets was painted by the great artist, Edwin Landseer, in 1838, showing the Queen's spaniel Dash, Lory the parrot, Nero the greyhound and Hector the deerhound. You don't give animals names if you're about to kill and eat them; you do when they become quasihumans.

Not that the Animal Rebellion protestors who defaced the Queen Victoria

Memorial in London yesterday - dying its water red apparently in opposition to the royal family allowing hunting on its land - will have stopped for a second to consider that the fountain's namesake heralded the era of the beloved pet.

There is another peculiar aspect to the British character that explains our love of cats and dogs: our awkwardness with our fellow human beings. We just aren't all that good at (sober) conversation, particularly with the opposite sex. And one of the great things about animals is you don't have to talk to them, although plenty of owners do have a one-sided conversation with their pets.

That is also to do with the Industrial Revolution. Thanks to factory life, men and women were segregated during the working day, in a way that didn't happen in the peasant economies of southern Europe, where farming families tended to live and work together until well into the 20th century.

It made us that much richer, too. A pet is, after all, another mouth to feed. Only a wealthy country like Britain - the richest nation in the world during the 19th century - could afford to look upon animals as friends, rather than lunch.

Our climate helps. The weather - while not much fun during a washout summer - is accommodating to breeds of animals from all over the world. Not least Afghan hounds, which were originally from Afghanistan and found their way to Britain. You try keeping a cat at the North Pole or taking a labrador for a walk in the Sahara. But most breeds of dog and cat can flourish on our temperate islands.

It's the same climate that encouraged us to get outdoors and create new sports in the 18th and 19th centuries. That meant hunting and shooting, both with dogs. That love of blood sports morphed into our modern habit of walking with dogs, without a gun or the need for a fox to chase after.

At the end of Dr No, James Bond is in Jamaica, having conquered his arch-enemy. He is about to leap into a double sleeping bag with his latest knockout girlfriend, Honey Rider. What could be more agreeable? And yet, despite being in tropical paradise, Bond finds himself longing for ""the douce weather of England"".

Quoting from Lord Chesterfield's 18th-century letters, Bond praises England, ""the only country where you can take a walk every day of the year"". And, he might have added, the only country where you can take your beloved dog for a walk every day of the year. Just as we like it.

Around 200 Extinction Rebellion activists gathered in the centre of London from 1.30pm, resulting in a number of streets near the bridge being closed for several hours.

Around 10 of them glued themselves to their bus, which was parked in the middle of a road, blocking traffic.

Some XR members gave speeches about climate change and there was also a performance from a samba band as they obstructed the roads as part of their two-week disruption of London.

Dozens of police officers and vans were called to attend to the scene and an officer confirmed that a number of arrests had been made. ""Officers are at the scene actively engaging with those assembled at London Bridge,"" Scotland Yard said. ""Officers are working to safely remove those who have attached themselves to the vehicle and the road.""

A total of 43 protesters were arrested for a variety of offences, the Metropolitan Police confirmed last night.

On Monday, XR activists had used a caravan to block Tower Bridge, which led to 11 people being arrested.

Meanwhile, members of the affiliated Animal Rebellion group blockaded the UK's largest dairy factory, operated by the company Arla. Around 50 activists arrived at the site in Aylesbury, Bucks, at 5am to erect two bamboo towers in front of the entrance and exit of the site.

A spokesman for Arla said it had worked with police to limit the impact of the action and that the morning shift changeover had been completed as normal, while production and transportation continued using its other 10 sites.

Protest organisers at Animal Rebellion, which calls itself a ""non-violent civil disobedience group"" campaigning for plant-based food systems, said about 50 protesters blocked entrances across four food distribution hubs.

Distribution sites at Hemel Hempstead, Basingstoke, Coventry and Heywood in Greater Manchester were affected. At some sites, protesters attached themselves to large bamboo structures they had erected.

Animal Rebellion, which calls itself a ""sister organisation"" toExtinction Rebellion, said that the demonstrations began at around 4.30am on Saturday and would last at least 24 hours. Protesters said they were targeting the burger restaurant for its role in deforestation and greenhouse gas emissions, contributing to the ""climate emergency"".

A McDonald's spokesman said: ""Our distribution centres are currently facing disruption. We are assessing the impact on deliveries to our restaurants and to menu items. We apologise to our customers for any disappointment caused.""

At the Heywood site, one protester, dressed as the Ronald McDonald clown mascot, placed himself in wooden stocks. Kerri Waters, another activist in Heywood, said police arrived there after protesters were involved in a ""scuffle"" with distribution centre staff.

Police keep their distance

A Greater Manchester Police spokesperson said: ""Officers are currently in attendance to maintain safety whilst facilitating the right to peaceful protest.""

Miss Waters told The Telegraph that the protest was ""not impacting the ordinary consumer - what we're trying to do is get attention from McDonald's.""

Alex Lockwood, a protest organiser, said: ""We know that simply stopping the trucks going [out of centres] will cause economic disruption to McDonald's.""

Mr Lockwood added that one of his organisation's aims was to pressure McDonald's, the home of the Big Mac burger, to scrap meat from its menus by 2025, to help reduce animal farming's impact on the environment.

""McDonald's beef burgers are a huge source, an iconic source, of greenhouse gas emissions,"" he said.

Members of vegan campaigning group Animal Rebellion group blocked lorries leaving distribution centres in Basingstoke, Hempstead and Heywood on Saturday.

Eight members of the group-which calls itself a ""sister organisation"" to the Extinction Rebellion movement-were arrested at an industrial estate in Basingstoke on suspicion of aggravated trespass, Hampshire Police said.

A further six people were arrested on suspicion of criminal damage, aggravated trespass and intimidating behaviour.

Matt Reeves, chief inspector of Hampshire Police, said: ""Everyone has the right to free speech and protest. However, officers will take necessary action against the few who deliberately choose to act outside the law.""

The activists have called on McDonald's to stop selling meat and switch to an entirely plant-based menu by 2025.

It forms part of Animal Rebellion's wider attempts to use ""non-violent civil disobedience to help the transition to a plant-based system"" and act ""in solidarity"" with Extinction Rebellion.

Protestors ended their blockade of a distribution centre in Coventry on Sunday morning after shackling themselves to bamboo towers for more than 24 hours.

West Midlands Police said that the Coventry protest caused ""safety concerns"" because the towers were blocking the entrance and exit of the building.

No arrests were made by Greater Manchester Police or West Midlands Police, the forces said. It is estimated that a total of 100 people took part in the protests across the four sites.

Animal Rebellion claimed that it disrupted 1,900 trucks throughout the weekend, amid customer complaints of burger and breakfast item shortages in branches of McDonald's across the country.

""For decades all they've been interested in is profit, with some of the unhealthiest foods you can eat,"" the group said in a statement.

144,The Daily Telegraph,Broadsheet,2021,Victoria Memorial outside Buckingham Palace vandalised by Animal Rebellion activists,"Environmental activists vandalised the fountains outside Buckingham Palace on Thursday in an extraordinary attack on the Royal family over its alleged ""crimes against animals and the planet"".

Activists from Animal Rebellion, an Extinction Rebellion sister organisation, daubed red liquid over the Queen Victoria Memorial, turning the water crimson, and left bloody handprints on the 100-year-old white marble monument.

Protesters were pictured wading through the water while carrying placards, which read: ""A royal blood bath"". Some carried flares emitting red smoke. Police officers were forced to leap into the water to try to remove them.

Harley McDonald-Eckersall, a spokesperson for Animal Rebellion, said: ""The crown estate is the biggest landowner in the UK and they choose to use this land for animal agriculture and hunting, which not only decimate our environment but cause the deaths of millions of lives every year. It's time for a new system based on justice and compassion and the royal family should be leading the way.

""Crown land should be used to grow healthy, nutritious food for all and to provide homes for the animals we share this country with.

""We are demanding that the Queen end the use of crown land for industries which are contributing to the climate and ecological emergency and the death of animals.""

The Metropolitan Police said several of the activists involved in the protest had been arrested. Members of the public visiting the palace on Thursday were ordered to disperse so forensic officers could take pictures of the red liquid smeared on the statue.

The vandalism at Buckingham Palace came after protesters blocked a major road in Westminster on Thursday afternoon, halting traffic on Victoria Street outside the Department of Business, Energy, and Industrial Strategy.

Traffic was also brought to a standstill around Hyde Park as demonstrators marched down Park Lane and Hyde Park Corner.

Westminster's council leader warned police chiefs this week that officers were allowing the activists to protest ""to the detriment of lives and livelihoods"".

In a letter to London's deputy mayor for policing and crime, Cllr Rachael Robathan said officers need to be taking ""clear action"" to ensure residents, businesses and visitors can continue to enjoy the city without being deterred by protesters.

Extinction Rebellion said local business owners they talked to ""have been delighted that Extinction Rebellion's 'polite and friendly' protesters have filled their bars and cafes"".

The Metropolitan Police have arrested 289 activists since Sunday when the protests began.

Activists taking part in Impossible Rebellion, a series of demonstrations which will last for a fortnight, are demanding that the Government immediately ends investment in fossil fuels that are driving climate change.

On Wednesday, protesters targeted the Brazilian embassy near Trafalgar Square in an action they said put a spotlight on ""the genocidal attacks being waged against Brazil's indigenous peoples"".

They then erected a giant pink table in Oxford Circus, blocking traffic to encourage world leaders to ""come to the table"" to engage with the issue of climate change.

They also blocked the entrance to Selfridges in nearby Oxford Street to demonstrate against clothes production, which they claim is damaging the environment. Protesters daubed themselves and the pavement with a black substance to represent an oil spill.

In 2015, more money was left in wills to the Donkey Sanctuary (£21m) than to the Royal British Legion (£16m), which raises funds from poppy-sellers to pay for wounded and troubled veterans. That year, a woman named Heather Ilott successfully sued and won £164,000, after her late mother left her nothing and bequeathed nearly £500,000 to the RSPCA, Blue Cross and the RSPB.

And who can forget the tale of Blackie, the donkey that dominated the headlines in 1987? The poor creature was doomed to carry the fattest man in a Spanish village during a festival that, the previous year, had seen the chosen animal die. A war broke out between tabloid newspapers to buy the donkey, with The Star beating The Sun, and bringing him to a donkey sanctuary in Devon - something presented as a triumph for British animal-lovers.

Our intense love of animals can be traced back to the Industrial Revolution. The huge migration of British workers from land to factory, and from country to city, starting in the 18th century, was the earliest in the world.

As the British agricultural economy turned industrial, and common land and smallholdings were increasingly enclosed for commercial purposes, our direct family connections with working animals broke down.

We moved to towns, so our dogs were no longer kept for herding sheep, nor our cats for keeping farmyard vermin at bay. We began to value them out of pure affection and pleasure. The RSPCA, the oldest and biggest animal welfare charity in the world, was founded in 1824.

Today, you can see a stark divide between animals kept for consumption and breeding - cows, sheep, pigs and chickens - and those pets kept for the sheer joy of it, principally cats and dogs. Even working dogs in the country - sheepdogs and hunting - have become the close companions of their owners.

That close affection between human and animal blossomed in the 19th century, not least in the portraits Queen Victoria and Prince Albert commissioned of their animals.

Again and again, the royal couple had their favourite pets and working animals painted. One of the most famous, Her Majesty's Favourite Pets was painted by the great artist, Edwin Landseer, in 1838, showing the Queen's spaniel Dash, Lory the parrot, Nero the greyhound and Hector the deerhound. You don't give animals names if you're about to kill and eat them; you do when they become quasi-humans.

Not that the Animal Rebellion protesters who defaced the Queen Victoria Memorial in London - dying the water red in opposition to the royal family allowing hunting on its land - will have stopped for a second to consider that the fountain's namesake heralded the era of the beloved pet.

There is another peculiar aspect to the British character that explains our love of cats and dogs - our awkwardness with our fellow human beings. We just aren't all that good at (sober) conversation, particularly with the opposite sex. And one of the great things about animals is you don't have to talk to them, although plenty of owners do have a one-sided conversation with their pets.

That is also to do with the Industrial Revolution. Thanks to factory life, men and women were segregated during the working day, in a way that didn't happen in the peasant economies of southern Europe, where farming families tended to live and work together, until well into the 20th century.

It made us that much richer, too. A pet is, after all, another mouth to feed. Only a wealthy country like Britain - the richest country in the world during the 19th century - could afford to look upon animals as friends, rather than lunch.

Our climate helps. The weather - while not much fun during a washout summer - is accommodating to breeds of animals from all over the world. Not least Afghan hounds, which were originally from Afghanistan and found their way to Britain. You try keeping a cat at the North Pole or taking a Labrador for a walk in the Sahara. But most breeds of dog and cat can flourish on our temperate islands.

It's the same climate that encouraged us to get outdoors and create new sports in the 18th and 19th centuries. That meant hunting and shooting, both with dogs. That love of blood sports morphed into our modern habit of walking with dogs, without a gun or the need for a fox to chase after.

At the end of Dr No, James Bond is in Jamaica, having conquered his arch-enemy. He is about to leap into a double sleeping-bag with his latest knockout girlfriend, Honey Rider. What could be more agreeable? And yet, despite being in tropical paradise, Bond finds himself longing for ""the douce weather of England"".

Quoting from Lord Chesterfield's 18th-century letters, Bond praises England, ""the only country where you can take a walk every day of the year"". And, he might have added, the only country where you can take your beloved dog for a walk every day of the year. Just as we like it."

An estimated 200 people gathered in the centre of London from 1.30pm, resulting in a number of streets near the bridge being closed for several hours.

Around ten of the activists glued themselves to a bus that the group had brought along, which was parked in the middle of a road to stop any traffic from getting through.

Some Extinction Rebellion members gave speeches about climate change and there was also a performance from a samba band as they obstructed the roads.

An officer confirmed some people taking part in the protest were being arrested, and the road closures would be in place ""for hours"".

A total of 43 protesters had been arrested for a variety of offences as at 6.45pm on Tuesday, the Metropolitan Police confirmed.

Scotland Yard said in a statement: ""Officers are responding to a demonstration in London Bridge where protesters have assembled and are blocking the road.

""We are currently assessing the situation working to keep disruption in the area to a minimum.

""Officers are on scene actively engaging with those assembled at London Bridge. Specially trained officers are working to safely remove those who have attached themselves to the vehicle and the road.""

On Monday, Extinction Rebellion activists had used a caravan to block Tower Bridge which led to 11 people being arrested.

The London Bridge protest came as members of the affiliated Animal Rebellion group blockaded the UK's largest dairy factory, which is operated by the company Arla.

Around 50 activists arrived at the site in Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire at 5am to erect two bamboo towers in front of the entrance and exit of the site.

A spokesman for Arla said it had worked with police to limit the impact of the action and that the morning shift changeover had been completed as normal, while production and transportation continued using its other 10 sites.

The demonstrations form part of a fortnight of Extinction Rebellion action which is intended to persuade the Government to immediately stop all investment in fossil fuels.

The activists from Animal Rebellion climbed the Home Office and the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra), ""demanding, that the world wake up and switch to a fully plant-based diet"".

The environmental campaigners say they plan to stay there ""indefinitely"".

Four activists from Animal Rebellion, an offshoot of Extinction Rebellion, used ladders, ropes and harnesses to climb as high as ""20 metres"" up the building at around 6am on Tuesday.

The group, which also let off flares, says it is demanding an end to subsidies for meat and dairy farming in a protest against climate change. They plan to stay in place until Boris Johnson pledges to urge all world leaders to also end such subsidies when they attend the Cop26 summit next week.

Police-who were criticised by some at the scene for ""just watching""-were liaising with the protesters, although no arrests had been made by Tuesday afternoon.

Nathan McGovern, an Animal Rebellion spokesman, said: ""Our protesters climbed the building in the early hours of this morning to send a clear message that we want an end to support for animal agriculture, which is killing our planet.

""The four, who are around 10 to 20 metres high, have unveiled a banner saying 'Cop26: Invest in a plant-based future'.

""We will see what the situation with the police is, but the plan is to stay in place indefinitely and this will remain a peaceful protest.""

Met hits back at critics saying officers 'just stand watching'

As with the policing of Insulate Britain's M25 protests, some criticised officers' alleged lack of action.

But the Met Police issued a statement defending their policing of Tuesday's protest.

The force said: ""We've seen a number of comments and questions around our response to a demonstration on Marsham Street today, where four activists have scaled a building. Firstly, we are working as quickly as possible to remove those who have climbed the building in the safest way.

""Working from height is incredibly complex and can be dangerous. With height, comes risk. We have specialist teams who train for these scenarios, but we must allow those officers to make a number of detailed assessments before they attempt to remove activists.

""Our primary concern is the safety of everyone involved, our officers and those protesting. If there was a fall this could result in serious injury. Despite some comments, we cannot haphazardly rush in and pull people down. This puts our officers at risk and those at height.

151,The Daily Telegraph,Broadsheet,2022,Animal Rebellion activists block milk aisles at shops in four cities,"ANIMAL Rebellion activists have blocked dairy aisles in supermarkets across the country in a campaign for a move to plant-based food production.

The group, which is an offshoot of Extinction Rebellion, wants an over haul of how food is made so it does not rely on animals, as part of the battle to combat climate change. Protesters yesterday sat down in front of milk supplies at a Whole Foods shop in London, and Marks & Spencer stores in Manchester, Birmingham and Southampton.

They held signs which read ""plantbased future"", ""rewild our land"" and ""animal farming = climate crisis"".

Animal Rebellion is calling for the Government to support farmers and fishing communities in a transition to plant-based food production, and to use the land freed up for rewilding as part of a broader programme of wildlife restoration and carbon draw-down.

In a protest earlier this year, the group tipped milk over the floor in Harrods, as it called for an end to the dairy industry. Other stunts include daubing the fountain outside Buckingham

Palace red to protest against the use of crown lands for hunting and animal agriculture.

Robert Gordon, one of the protesters involved in the latest action to block dairy aisles, said: ""Animal farming and fishing are leading causes of our climate and ecological crises. Supermarkets claim to be environmentally conscious, yet they continue to stock from the destructive meat, fish, and dairy industries. With this sit-in, we are making a clear statement that only a plant-based food system can alleviate the threat posed by climate breakdown.""

The group attracted criticism online for disrupting customers' shopping, with one person saying: ""I'd argue that blocking dairies and abattoirs is a more effective and popular tactic.""

The group defended its actions by pointing to this year's heatwaves.

If you happen to be going shopping in West London this week, remember to take an umbrella. Nothing to do with the weather forecast. It's purely to stop vegan activists from drenching you with very expensive milk.

The risk has become worryingly high. On Friday, protesters from Animal Rebellion - an offshoot of the eco-warrior group Extinction Rebellion - emptied large volumes of milk all over the floor at both Selfridges and Fortnum and Mason. They'd previously emptied milk all over the floor at Harrods. The aim of these stunts, the protesters say, is ""to highlight the environmental destruction of the dairy industry"".

These days, of course, protests by green groups have become so commonplace - only yesterday, members of Just Stop Oil glued themselves to the Mall in front of Buckingham Palace - that they scarcely seem worth reporting any more. What makes these Animal Rebellion protests interesting, though, is their choice of venue. Milk, after all, is sold in countless thousands of shops and supermarkets all over Britain. So why is it that these protesters only ever seem to carry out their milksodden stunts in the most exclusive department stores of West London?

I believe there are two possible explanations. One is that these vegan protesters are so frightfully posh that they don't actually know any of the major supermarket chains frequented by the general public, and view

Harrods as nothing more than their local corner shop.

On the whole, though, I suspect the real explanation is that they think it's safer. The sort of people who shop at Harrods, Fortnum's and Selfridges, they reason, are dependably well-bred and restrained, and will therefore respond to the milk-splashing stunt with nothing more violent than a tut and a shake of the head. The response might be somewhat different, the protesters sense, were they to carry out the same stunt in, say, a Blackpool branch of Budgens, or a Middlesbrough Lidl. The patrons of such establishments, they fear, might not appreciate the delicate nuances of their protest's rationale.

""But sir! We were merely attempting to emphasise the urgent need to transition to a sustainable plant-based food system! I'm dreadfully sorry that the milk ruined your trainers, but surely you must concede that, for the sake of the environment, it's a price well worth paying! No!

161,The Daily Telegraph,Broadsheet,2022,"The law privileges Just Stop Oil revolutionaries over the public, and it's becoming intolerable; These activists are extreme, and the police are doing far too little to prevent them from disrupting our lives

","Section 137 of the Highways Act 1980 says it is an offence ""if a person, without lawful authority or excuse, in any way wilfully obstructs the free passage along a highway"". Why, then, do so many protesters block the highway and remain unpunished?

There can be few people, especially in London, or attempting to drive round the M25, who do not ask themselves this question just now. Protesters, the latest being Just Stop Oil, make such obstruction their speciality.

The police are timid in enforcing the law. In mid-October, two activists suspended themselves above the Queen Elizabeth II Bridge, thus closing the Dartford Crossing, probably the busiest pinch-point of the busiest motorway in the country. It took Essex Police two days to remove and arrest them. In September, another blockage at junction three of the M25 kept 18,000 drivers stuck for hours, some blocked for hospital treatment or school runs.

Similar questions arise about criminal damage. Protesters have taken to gluing themselves to works of art in public collections and spraying public buildings with paint. Over the past month, 8,000 front-line police shifts have been diverted from normal duties to dealing with such protests, yet ""dealing with"" is the wrong phrase. The police are there in force, but force is not what they use. Mostly, they just stand around.

As someone who lives in the country but quite often comes to London, I see frequent, less dramatic examples in both places. Local trail hunts are often disrupted by intimidating gangs of animal-rights extremists who commit various offences such as filming children and mass trespass. Quite often, police turn up and hang about, but never - and I have witnessed such scenes more than 100 times - have I seen a police arrest. On one occasion (at which I was not present), there were arrests, after the ""antis"" cracked a man's skull. The case was dropped because the assailants, being masked, were unidentifiable.

Comparable police inaction is commonplace when travellers illegally occupy and often defile private or public land. The most famous current example of police reticence, of course, are the immigrants landing in their thousands on the South Coast. Again, the police arrive merely to witness the mass illegality, not prevent it.

In London, my work takes me to Westminster. Hardly a day passes there without protests which cause annoyance to pedestrians, residents or office workers. These vary from causing delay in walking down a street, through megaphone noise making it hard to work, right up to breakages, total blockage of streets and scuffles with exasperated members of the public.

Opposite Downing Street, a permanent camp is permitted, and crowds at the security gates are often allowed to yell so loud that they interfere with normal life (and, indeed, with prime ministers choosing to announce their resignations there - nowadays an almost weekly occurrence).

I find this upsetting: I am just old enough to remember when pedestrians could pass through Downing Street unchallenged. It was considered a proud aspect of our parliamentary democracy that the prime minister lived in a mere street and that we could walk down it. That freedom has long since succumbed to the threats of terrorists and mobs.

I have never before seen a proper overall analysis of these problems, so this week's short report (The ""Just Stop Oil"" Protests) by the think-tank Policy Exchange is timely. It brings together all the elements.

The first explains who the protesters are. The organisations involved have different names - Extinction Rebellion, Insulate Britain, Animal Rebellion, Just Stop Oil - but the same people. They are extreme, calling for revolution, and apocalyptic, declaring ""this civilisation is finished"" and flirting with the idea of suicide as a response to ""climate grief "".

Policy Exchange reveals that some protesters have had to sign a declaration in which they ""formally pledge to take part in action which will lead to my arrest"", for which they will undergo ""a one-day non-violence training"". ""Nonviolence"" seems to be narrowly defined: things like breaking bottles in supermarkets, smashing windows of public buildings or spraying paint on buildings are ""peaceful"". These are not normal concerned citizens: they are fanatics, led by seasoned agitators, such as the ubiquitous Roger Hallam, who want them to break the law and then exploit all its ambiguities in court.

The reason why the law of the highway is not enforced lies in the interpretation of other laws. Ever since

Britain subjected itself to the Human Rights Act of 2000, our indigenous law has been contradicted by what is inaccurately called ""the right to protest"", which appears in the European Convention on Human Rights.

In a 2021 case known as Ziegler, our

Supreme Court held that this right sometimes provides a ""lawful excuse"" for blocking a highway and that juries would have to weigh up whether a conviction for blocking was ""necessary in a democratic society"". This imports politics into the law and makes every case arguable, as does the ridiculous defence of protesters for their ""sincerity"". Their sincerity does not diminish their nuisance to others. Most of the greatest extremists are sincere.

This unsatisfactory Ziegler ruling is typical of the effect of the European Convention on Human Rights and should be changed by legislation. It largely explains police weakness in these situations. It is hard for them to be confident if a protester they arrest is charged. If he or she can persuade a jury he is sincere and that his conviction is not ""necessary to a democratic society"", he can get off. How can juries work that out? They are there to determine fact, not maintain the balance of the constitution.

The police therefore worry that doing their job by clearing the highway quickly might get them into trouble. With this doubt in their mind, their trade's theologians have a field day setting out guidelines. Policy Exchange's report publishes the College of Policing's ""Five Step Appeal"" model which guides officers dealing with protesters. It starts with ""simple appeal - ask the person to comply with your request"", and goes up through ""reasoned appeal"", ""personal appeal"" and ""final appeal"" to ""action"" - by which time it is usually too late to make much difference.

To this is added the well-known police addiction to monopoly. The Just Stop Oil protesters love sticking themselves to objects in museums. All major museums have security and conservation experts who know how to unglue offenders very quickly, yet the police forbid this and insist on sending their own crack squad, which takes ages.

A Public Order Bill is going through Parliament. It has no helpful provisions on any of the above. One amendment seeks to create 150-metre ""buffer zones"" around abortion clinics to prevent anti-abortionists approaching pregnant women. The penalty would be six months' imprisonment.

This would seem a classic example of the wrong way to go. Public order law should not pick and choose which causes it approves. We could end up with a situation where a woman who prays for a pregnant woman a hundred yards away goes to prison, whereas maniacs who block the road for days in the interests of revolution cannot be convicted. The law should not encourage one protester and forbid another.

As with so much rights-based legislation, the current state of our law privileges tiresome activists over the freedoms of people in general. In doing so, it damages our model of policing by consent, and drives us towards taking the law into our own hands.

162,The Daily Telegraph,Broadsheet,2022,Scots students go vegan after vote by 100,"MEAT and dairy products are set to be banned on a university campus after students voted to go vegan.

Stirling University's student union backed a move towards a plant-based menu at the three food outlets it controls, with activists to demand that the policy is adopted across the entire institution.

The campaign group Animal Rebellion, which has links to Extinction Rebellion, said the move was a first for Britain and would help ""address the climate and ecological emergencies"" due to emissions linked to farming.

However, the Countryside Alliance branded it an ""illogical"" snub to Scottish farmers and called on the university to intervene to ensure a more democratic process.

Only around 100 of the university's 17,000 students took part in the vote.

Mo Metcalf-Fisher, a spokesman for the Countryside

Alliance, said: ""Obviously this is an attack on freedom of choice imposed by a tiny number of students on the wider student body.

""Stirling's students' union would be much better off sourcing sustainable local meat and dairy produce from Scottish farmers instead.

""How can an avocado flown in from South America have eco-superiority over a piece of grass fed beef from a local farm?

""Stirling University should demonstrate its support for

Scottish farmers by ensuring they continue to supply meat and dairy, irrespective of what its students' union decide to do.""

The university said the vote would only affect outlets run by the students union and that it remained committed to offering ""choice"" at the catering facilities that it controlled.

However, Imogen Robertson, 21, a student at Stirling, said campaigners would be seeking talks with the uni versity about imposing the meat and dairy ban across the campus.

""We won't be shying away from having the difficult conversations around the need for transitioning to a plantbased food system,"" she said.

""We are planning to dis cuss our campaign with the university itself and to push for the transition to plantbased catering to go further than just the student union.

""We know there is a lot of work to do but are prepared to work with all parties to facilitate this UK-first being a reality.""

The motion backed by students calls for 50 per cent of products at the union to be plant-based by September next year, rising to 100 per cent by 2025.

","A Just Stop Oil ""poster boy"" smashed a petrol pump as part of protests on Thursday morning as police were urged to prevent motorists being ""held hostage"".

In a ""significant escalation"" in tactics , around 35 protesters, many of them veteran environmental activists, blocked two petrol station forecourts on the M25 for several hours on Thursday morning, with some also spray-painting and smashing the pump displays.The protesters arrived at the two sites - Cobham Services in Surrey and Clacket Lane Services in Kent - at 7am on Thursday, with the first arrests not taking place until after 11am.

Among them was Louis McKechnie, 21, a former engineering student from Weymouth with a three-year history of eco-activism, who was pictured vandalising a pump just two weeks after chaining himself to pipework at an oil facility in Grays, Essex.

Edmund King, the president of the AA, said the protests were ""incredibly dangerous"" because of smart motorways in the area and said Britain's transport system was being ""held hostage"".

""People are reliant on fuel for essential business. The number of vans, the number of commercial vehicles that use those services, it's kind of the backbone of Britain.

""It is totally irresponsible to take this kind of action. So hopefully the police will take action and clear it up soon. It is holding transport hostage.""

Mr McKechnie, the son of a Green Party councillor, has previously been arrested for dyeing the fountains outside Buckingham Palace red as part of actions organised by Extinction Rebellion offshoot Animal Rebellion.

Last year, he sat down in front of traffic as part of weeks of Insulate Britain protests which saw roads around London and the south-east repeatedly blocked by activists gluing themselves to the tarmac in front of cars.

He was released from prison on New Year's Eve after serving half of a three-month sentence for breaching an injunction against the protests, and said he felt ""emboldened"" by his time behind bars.

Two days after release he joined Just Stop Oil, a new group with a youthful leadership, which first made headlines when it disrupted the Bafta ceremony last month.

Since then it has targeted Premier League football matches and fuel infrastructure, blocking oil terminals in a bid to disrupt supply to petrol stations. In total over 1,000 arrests have been made.

Other protesters included Nathan McGovern, 22, a Masters student in religion at King's College London, who previously disrupted a game of football between Tottenham Hotspur and West Ham on behalf of the group, and Stephanie Golder, 34, a charity project coordinator from Essex.

The petrol station vandalism represents a ""significant escalation"" in tactics, the group said, in a bid to garner more attention from the Government and public, after previous actions to block oil supply terminals did not raise enough interest.The group said it ""will continue the disruption until the government makes a statement that it will end new oil and gas projects in the UK.""

Surrey Police said 27 people had been arrested, with at least eight held on suspicion of criminal damage and aggravated trespass.

On Thursday afternoon a spokesman added: ""We appreciate that this incident has been ongoing for some time and is causing considerable disruption but removing protesters who have glued themselves to vehicles and petrol pumps is a lengthy and complex process and has to be carried out using specialist equipment.""",Right,0,557,"Just Stop Oil 'poster boy' among saboteurs in M25 petrol pump protest

The Met Police said a ""number of arrests"" were made of people ""who attempted to enter the ceremonial route in The Mall at approximately 10.10ths today"".

The demonstrators, who were seen lying on The Mall in front of the parading soldiers, were dragged away by police in front of thousands of onlookers and detained in St. James' Park.

Four men are thought to have been involved, including one who lay down on the road.

The men were dragged by police to the side of the road. The band played-and marched-on.

One protester, wearing a gold crown and green jumper, sat on the grass cross-legged with his hands tied behind his back as nine to 10 police formed a circle around him and Ben Mitchell, another protester.

The two men, who were under arrest, told The Telegraph that the group ""had no other choice"" than to disrupt the celebration of the Queen's Platinum Jubilee.

Mitchell, 20, said: ""If that means jumping in front of a military parade, not something we want to do-we saw all the armed police and were shitting ourselves-but we literally have no time left and it's just a matter of trying to get across how much of a crisis this is.

""If that requires a 20-year-old being dragged away in handcuffs for people to realise how much of a crisis this is then so be it.""

The other demonstrator, who said this was his first action for Animal Rebellion added that he would get arrested ""any number of times"" for the cause of climate change.

""I've got nothing against the Queen apart from the fact that she's an incredibly powerful woman who has done absolutely nothing to steer her government to take the action that they promised they would take at COP26,"" he said.

""She is in an incredible position in this country and in the Commonwealth and she has failed us all.""

Mitchell, who has been a member of the climate activism group for just under a year, said: ""We must quite literally do everything we possibly can within the next three to four years and if that means coming back here, coming to the next public event with 100 people, we just absolutely have to do it.""

The group's demonstration today was a call for the Royal family to transition the land they own away from animal agriculture and re-wild it, meaning to return the land to it's natural state.

He said: ""Animal agriculture is not only a vast source of emissions, it's also a vast source of land degradation and one of the most important things we can do for the climate crisis is to bring back nature, bring back trees, bring back biodiversity.

""If the Royal family was to-and Prince Charles claims to be someone who really cares about the climate crisis-if they were serious about that they would act on this.""

The second protester added: ""I won't be complicit, everyone should take a stand, everybody knows what's happening. We won't be bystanders.""

In a statement, Just Stop Oil said: ""We are not backing down.

""Yesterday, a group of Just Stop Oil supporters remained resolutely nonviolent when confronted by the understandably frustrated members of the public.

""One supporter required emergency medical treatment due to having been removed from the road by a member of the public.

""The disruption will end when the Government makes a statement that it will halt all future licensing and consents for the exploration, development and production of fossil fuels in the UK.""

Sunday's sit-down has followed protests in the capital every day since last Saturday.

On Saturday the organisation teamed up with Animal Rebellion, an off-shoot of Extinction Rebellion, to bring large parts of the capital to a standstill.

A Met Police spokesman said: ""While we recognise that this manner of protest can be frustrating for motorists, we wouldn’t encourage members of the public to intervene directly.

""We have specialist officers who are trained in removing protestors safely and efficiently.

""As we have shown this weekend, where roads are blocked we will intervene swiftly to deal with any offences and to get traffic moving as quickly as we can. On Saturday we arrested 42 people for obstructing the highway and on Sunday we arrested a further 47."""
172,The Daily Telegraph,Broadsheet,2022,"In these tough times, please spare a thought for poor Meghan and Harry","Why are these protests so posh?

If you happen to be going shopping in West London this week, remember to take an umbrella. Nothing to do with the weather forecast. It’s purely to stop vegan activists from drenching you with very expensive milk.

The risk has become worryingly high. On Friday, protesters from Animal Rebellion – an offshoot of the eco-warrior group Extinction Rebellion – emptied large volumes of milk all over the floor at both Selfridges and Fortnum & Mason. They’d previously emptied milk all over the floor at Harrods. The aim of these stunts, the protesters say, is “to highlight the environmental destruction [caused by] the dairy industry”.

These days, of course, protests by green groups have become so commonplace – only yesterday, members of Just Stop Oil glued themselves to the Mall in front of Buckingham Palace – that they scarcely seem worth reporting any more. What makes these Animal Rebellion protests interesting, though, is their choice of venue. Milk, after all, is sold in countless thousands of shops and supermarkets all over Britain. So why is it that these protesters only ever seem to carry out their milk-sodden stunts in the most exclusive department stores of West London?

I believe there are two possible explanations. One is that these vegan protesters are so marvellously posh that they don’t actually know any of the major supermarket chains frequented by the general public, and view Harrods as nothing more than their local corner shop.

On the whole, though, I suspect the real explanation is that they think it’s safer. The sort of people who shop at Harrods, Fortnums and Selfridges, they reason, are dependably well-bred and restrained, and will therefore respond to the milk-splashing stunt with nothing more violent than a tut and a shake of the head. The response might be somewhat different, the protesters sense, were they to carry out the same stunt in, say, a Blackpool branch of Budgens, or a Middlesbrough Lidl. The patrons of such establishments, they fear, might not appreciate the delicate nuances of their protest’s rationale.

“But sir! We were merely attempting to emphasise the urgent need to transition to a sustainable plant-based food system! I’m dreadfully sorry that the milk ruined your trainers, but surely you must concede that, for the sake of the environment, it’s a price well worth paying! No!

174,The Daily Telegraph,Broadsheet,2022,26 arrested as angry motorists drag Just Stop Oil protesters from road,"An MP questioned what the reaction would be if a ""couple of black boys"" had thrown soup on a Van Gogh, as environmental activists continued with a 15th day of protests on Saturday.

James Cleverly said “let’s stop giving these attention seeking adult-toddlers the coverage they clearly crave” after members of Just Stop Oil were dragged off a busy road by angry members of the public on Saturday.

The Foreign Secretary tweeted: ""I’m just wondering what the reaction would be if a couple of black boys from Lewisham had thrown soup on a Van Gogh or poured milk all over the floor in Harrods.""

Shortly after midday, 29 supporters of the group sat down on the tarmac at the junction of Shoreditch High Street and Great Eastern Street causing gridlock on the surrounding roads.

Some protesters glued themselves to the road surface, while others held up banners demanding an end to the use of fossil fuels.

But frustrated motorists who were caught up in the road chaos reacted by physically dragging some of the activists out of the way.

The Met Police said 26 arrests were made on Saturday for wilful obstruction of the highway.

Members of Just Stop Oil have been carrying out daily action throughout October as part of a campaign to persuade the Government to halt all new oil and gas licences.

As well as blocking roads, members of the group have also carried out stunts intended to generate publicity and bring attention to their demands.

Two women appeared in court on Saturday charged with criminal damage following an incident at the National Gallery on Friday in which tomato soup was thrown at Van Gogh’s Sunflowers painting.

Anna Holland, 20, from Newcastle, and Phoebe Plummer, 21, from Lambeth, south-west London, both pleaded not guilty to criminal damage to the frame of the painting in a hearing at Westminster Magistrates' Court.

Another Just Stop Oil activist, Lora Johnson, 38, from Southwold, also appeared in court after paint was thrown at the famous revolving sign outside Scotland Yard.

Appearing in the dock together, Holland and Plummer spoke only to confirm their name, date of birth, addresses and to enter pleas of not guilty to criminal damage to the value of less than £5,000.

Prosecutor Ola Oyedepo said the pair threw the ""orange substance"" knowing there was a ""protective case"" over the actual painting, though damage was caused to the frame.

Ms Oyedepo said it is unclear at this stage what the value of the damage is but said it is ""significantly below the £5,000 cost threshold"".

She said the pair ""did not damage the picture because the picture is worth millions"".

Katie McFadden, defending, said: ""The prosecution needs to prove that damage has been caused.""

She said the ""extent of the damage would be relevant to the proportionality assessment"" in weighing up their right to expression.

District judge Tan Irkam released the pair on bail on the condition they do not enter galleries or museums and do not have paint or adhesive substances in a public place.

He set their trial for December 13 at City of London Magistrates' Court.

Meanwhile, Johnson, who appeared in the dock for a separate hearing, also spoke to confirm her name, address and enter a not guilty plea.

Ms Oyepedo said Johnson was part of a protest group which gathered at the New Scotland Yard building on Friday afternoon.

""They glued themselves to the floor while she went up to spray the sign,"" she said.

The prosecutor said £4,750 has been spent trying to remove the paint from the sign and the ground under it.

Mr Irkam released Johnson on bail on the condition she does not have paint or adhesive materials in a public place and set her trial for November 23 at City of London Magistrates' Court.

""The court will not prevent you from lawfully protesting,"" Mr Irkam said.

The Just Stop Oil group have vowed to continue with the campaign until the government meets its demands.

A spokesman for the group said: “[On Friday] Just Stop Oil supporters threw soup over Van Gogh’s Sunflowers on display in the National Gallery and paint over the Metropolitan Police’s iconic New Scotland Yard sign.

“We accept that both these actions have upset and provoked many people, as will the disruption caused by today’s road block.

“But our art, culture and the rule of law is threatened. Our heritage, rights and freedoms are being destroyed by our government’s lies and the failure of politics, and right now millions of people are facing this brutal impact of climate change.

“Yet our government is seeking to expand fossil fuel production.”

More than 400 people have been arrested in connection with the disruption since it began in April.

The spokesman added: “This is not a one day event, expect us every day and anywhere. This is an act of resistance against a criminal government and their genocidal death project.

“Our supporters will be returning – today, tomorrow and the next day – and the next day after that – and every day until our demand is met: no new oil and gas in the UK.”

175,The Daily Telegraph,Broadsheet,2022,"The law privileges Just Stop Oil revolutionaries over the public, and it’s becoming intolerable","Section 137 of the Highways Act 1980 says it is an offence “if a person, without lawful authority or excuse, in any way wilfully obstructs the free passage along a highway”. Why, then, do so many protesters block the highway and remain unpunished ?

There can be few people, especially in London, or attempting to drive round the M25, who do not ask themselves this question just now. Protesters, the latest being Just Stop Oil , make such obstruction their speciality.

The police are timid in enforcing the law. In mid-October, two activists suspended themselves above the Queen Elizabeth II Bridge, thus closing the Dartford Crossing, probably the busiest pinch-point of the busiest motorway in the country. It took Essex Police two days to remove and arrest them. In September, another blockage at junction three of the M25 kept 18,000 drivers stuck for hours, some blocked for hospital treatment or school runs.

Similar questions arise about criminal damage. Protesters have taken to gluing themselves to works of art in public collections and spraying public buildings with paint. Over the past month, 8,000 front-line police shifts have been diverted from normal duties to dealing with such protests, yet “dealing with” is the wrong phrase. The police are there in force, but force is not what they use. Mostly, they just stand around.

As someone who lives in the country but quite often comes to London, I see frequent, less dramatic examples in both places. Local trail hunts are often disrupted by intimidating gangs of animal-rights extremists who commit various offences such as filming children and mass trespass. Quite often, police turn up and hang about, but never – and I have witnessed such scenes more than 100 times – have I seen a police arrest. On one occasion (at which I was not present), there were arrests, after the “antis” cracked a man’s skull. The case was dropped because the assailants, being masked, were unidentifiable.

Comparable police inaction is commonplace when travellers illegally occupy and often defile private or public land. The most famous current example of police reticence, of course, are the immigrants landing in their thousands on the South Coast. Again, the police arrive merely to witness the mass illegality, not prevent it.

In London, my work takes me to Westminster. Hardly a day passes there without protests which cause annoyance to pedestrians, residents or office workers. These vary from causing delay in walking down a street, through megaphone noise making it hard to work, right up to breakages, total blockage of streets and scuffles with exasperated members of the public.

Opposite Downing Street, a permanent camp is permitted, and crowds at the security gates are often allowed to yell so loud that they interfere with normal life (and, indeed, with prime ministers choosing to announce their resignations there – nowadays an almost weekly occurrence).

I find this upsetting: I am just old enough to remember when pedestrians could pass through Downing Street unchallenged. It was considered a proud aspect of our parliamentary democracy that the prime minister lived in a mere street and that we could walk down it. That freedom has long since succumbed to the threats of terrorists and mobs.

I have never before seen a proper overall analysis of these problems, so this week’s short report (The “Just Stop Oil” Protests) by the think-tank Policy Exchange is timely. It brings together all the elements.

The first explains who the protesters are. The organisations involved have different names – Extinction Rebellion, Insulate Britain, Animal Rebellion, Just Stop Oil – but the same people. They are extreme, calling for revolution, and apocalyptic, declaring “this civilisation is finished” and flirting with the idea of suicide as a response to “climate grief”.

Policy Exchange reveals that some protesters have had to sign a declaration in which they “formally pledge to take part in action which will lead to my arrest”, for which they will undergo “a one-day non-violence training”. “Nonviolence” seems to be narrowly defined: things like breaking bottles in supermarkets, smashing windows of public buildings or spraying paint on buildings are “peaceful”. These are not normal concerned citizens: they are fanatics, led by seasoned agitators, such as the ubiquitous Roger Hallam , who want them to break the law and then exploit all its ambiguities in court.

The reason why the law of the highway is not enforced lies in the interpretation of other laws. Ever since Britain subjected itself to the Human Rights Act of 2000, our indigenous law has been contradicted by what is inaccurately called “the right to protest”, which appears in the European Convention on Human Rights.

In a 2021 case known as Ziegler, our Supreme Court held that this right sometimes provides a “lawful excuse” for blocking a highway and that juries would have to weigh up whether a conviction for blocking was “necessary in a democratic society”. This imports politics into the law and makes every case arguable, as does the ridiculous defence of protesters for their “sincerity”. Their sincerity does not diminish their nuisance to others. Most of the greatest extremists are sincere.

This unsatisfactory Ziegler ruling is typical of the effect of the European Convention on Human Rights and should be changed by legislation. It largely explains police weakness in these situations. It is hard for them to be confident if a protester they arrest is charged. If he or she can persuade a jury he is sincere and that his conviction is not “necessary to a democratic society”, he can get off. How can juries work that out? They are there to determine fact, not maintain the balance of the constitution.

The police therefore worry that doing their job by clearing the highway quickly might get them into trouble. With this doubt in their mind, their trade’s theologians have a field day setting out guidelines. Policy Exchange’s report publishes the College of Policing’s “Five Step Appeal” model which guides officers dealing with protesters. It starts with “simple appeal – ask the person to comply with your request”, and goes up through “reasoned appeal”, “personal appeal” and “final appeal” to “action” – by which time it is usually too late to make much difference.

To this is added the well-known police addiction to monopoly. The Just Stop Oil protesters love sticking themselves to objects in museums. All major museums have security and conservation experts who know how to unglue offenders very quickly, yet the police forbid this and insist on sending their own crack squad, which takes ages.

A Public Order Bill is going through Parliament. It has no helpful provisions on any of the above. One amendment seeks to create 150-metre “buffer zones” around abortion clinics to prevent anti-abortionists approaching pregnant women. The penalty would be six months’ imprisonment.

This would seem a classic example of the wrong way to go. Public order law should not pick and choose which causes it approves. We could end up with a situation where a woman who prays for a pregnant woman a hundred yards away goes to prison, whereas maniacs who block the road for days in the interests of revolution cannot be convicted. The law should not encourage one protester and forbid another.

As with so much rights-based legislation, the current state of our law privileges tiresome activists over the freedoms of people in general. In doing so, it damages our model of policing by consent, and drives us towards taking the law into our own hands.",Right,0,1241,"The law privileges Just Stop Oil revolutionaries over the public, and it’s becoming intolerableSection 137 of the Highways Act 1980 says it is an offence “if a person, without lawful authority or excuse, in any way wilfully obstructs the free passage along a highway”.

This imports politics into the law and makes every case arguable, as does the ridiculous defence of protesters for their “sincerity”. Their sincerity does not diminish their nuisance to others. Most of the greatest extremists are sincere.

This unsatisfactory Ziegler ruling is typical of the effect of the European Convention on Human Rights and should be changed by legislation. It largely explains police weakness in these situations. It is hard for them to be confident if a protester they arrest is charged. If he or she can persuade a jury he is sincere and that his conviction is not “necessary to a democratic society”, he can get off. How can juries work that out? They are there to determine fact, not maintain the balance of the constitution.

The police therefore worry that doing their job by clearing the highway quickly might get them into trouble. With this doubt in their mind, their trade’s theologians have a field day setting out guidelines. Policy Exchange’s report publishes the College of Policing’s “Five Step Appeal” model which guides officers dealing with protesters. It starts with “simple appeal – ask the person to comply with your request”, and goes up through “reasoned appeal”, “personal appeal” and “final appeal” to “action” – by which time it is usually too late to make much difference.

To this is added the well-known police addiction to monopoly. The Just Stop Oil protesters love sticking themselves to objects in museums. All major museums have security and conservation experts who know how to unglue offenders very quickly, yet the police forbid this and insist on sending their own crack squad, which takes ages.

A Public Order Bill is going through Parliament. It has no helpful provisions on any of the above. One amendment seeks to create 150-metre “buffer zones” around abortion clinics to prevent anti-abortionists approaching pregnant women. The penalty would be six months’ imprisonment.

This would seem a classic example of the wrong way to go. Public order law should not pick and choose which causes it approves. We could end up with a situation where a woman who prays for a pregnant woman a hundred yards away goes to prison, whereas maniacs who block the road for days in the interests of revolution cannot be convicted. The law should not encourage one protester and forbid another.

As with so much rights-based legislation, the current state of our law privileges tiresome activists over the freedoms of people in general. In doing so, it damages our model of policing by consent, and drives us towards taking the law into our own hands."

It is ""only a matter of time"" before someone is killed by a Just Stop Oil protest, a police chief has warned after his officer was knocked off a motorcycle and injured on the M25.

BJ Harrington, chief constable of Essex Police, told The Telegraph he was ""devastated"" that the roads policing officer was hurt on Wednesday responding to the activists’ latest motorway stunt.

He said there was ""nobody responsible"" for the officer’s injury ""other than Just Stop Oil"", whose activists have been climbing gantries on the 116-mile London orbital all week to force road closures.

The injured officer had been trying to implement a ""rolling roadblock""-to help ease existing traffic before a road can be closed-between Junctions 26 and 27 when two lorries crashed and knocked him off his bike.

He was taken to hospital but it is hoped that he will make a full recovery.

Mr Harrington told The Telegraph: ""It's been a game changer today, if indeed you could describe this as a game because it is a pretty serious one"".

His remarks came after Suella Braverman condemned Just Stop Oil's ""guerilla tactics"" after activists scaling gantries this morning led to a police officer being injured in a collision on the busy motorway.

Speaking to journalists after her speech, Home Secretary Suella Braverman referred to Just Stop Oil protesters as ""extremists"".

She said: ""There are many thousands of police days-not just within the Met but also from other forces because we're adding resources from forces outside those which are directly affected-thousands of police days and hours which are being diverted away from, you know, combating rape and homicide and burglary, diverted to dealing with these extremists.""

She said she has concerns about how forces are interpreting laws around how much disruption protests cause.

""I've got some concerns about the interpretation of serious disruption and when that threshold is hit, and also the cumulative impact.

""So when we see a daily reset do you assess it cumulatively over a 10-day period or week or do you say, well I'm just measuring it in a 24 hour period?

Braverman: 'It is not a civil liberty to stop ambulances getting to the sick'

Home Secretary Suella Braverman told police chiefs at a conference in Westminster

Although most police officers do an excellent job, sadly, in recent months and years we have seen an erosion of confidence in the police to take action against the radicals, the road-blockers, the vandals, the militants and the extremists.

But we have also seen the police appear to lose confidence in themselves; in yourselves. In your authority, in your power. An institutional reluctance. This must change.

Criminal damage, obstructing the highway, public nuisance – none of it should be humoured. It is not a human right to vandalise a work of art. It is not a civil liberty to stop ambulances getting to the sick and injured.

Such disruption is a threat to our way of life. It does not ‘further a cause’. It is not ‘freedom of expression’ and I want to reassure you that you have my – and this government’s – full backing in taking a firmer line to safeguard public order. Indeed, that is your duty.

Scenes of members of the public taking the law into their own hands are a sign of a loss of confidence and I urge you all to step up to your public duties in policing protests.

The Society of Editors has said that it is deeply concerned and ""strongly condemns"" the arrest this week of journalists covering Just Stop Oil protests.

The Society’s intervention comes after LBC reporter Charlotte Lynch was arrested on Tuesday by Hertfordshire Police while covering a protest by the climate activist group.

Her arrest comes only a day after reports that officers from Hertfordshire constabulary had arrested documentary film maker Rich Felgate and photographer Tom Bowles on Monday. All had been covering protests by Just Stop Oil on the M25.

Responding to the arrests, Dawn Alford, Executive Director of the Society of Editors said: ""The Society is deeply concerned by reports this week of a number of journalists being arrested while reporting on protests by the campaign group Just Stop Oil.

""The protests are a source of legitimate public interest and journalists, film-makers and photographers have a right to attend protests and report on behalf of the public.

Journalist tells of 'terrifying' five hours in cell after Just Stop Oil arrest

A radio journalist has spoken of the ""terrifying"" five hours she endured in a police cell after being arrested while reporting on a Just Stop Oil protest.

Charlotte Lynch, of LBC, had been reporting on the activists from a road bridge over junction 21 of the M25, in Hertfordshire, on Tuesday, for around 45 minutes when she was approached and questioned by two officers.

After showing them a press card and having explained she was reporting on the demonstration, the officers handcuffed her, took her phone and arrested her on conspiracy to commit a public nuisance.

It comes after a photographer and filmmaker said they were held in police custody for around 13 hours for covering a protest staged by the group.

Ms Lynch said she was searched on the side of the road, before officers seized her devices and took her to a police station in a custody van.

She said: ""Got to Stevenage police station, that journey took over an hour because of the M25 being closed.

""I was in the back of a police van, handcuffed, my hands were in front of me, handcuffed the entire time, on my own, the two police officers were behind the glass cage.

""That's when it dawned on me 'gosh, I could be charged here' and everything runs through your mind 'have I actually committed this offence?' even though I knew I hadn't.""

It was absolutely terrifying being in a cell with a pad for a bed in one corner and a metal toilet in the other. I was just doing my job. What’s also terrifying is what this means for press freedom. It was blindingly obvious I was a reporter. Thank you for the kind messages x

Telegraph View: The hysterical activists of Just Stop Oil are undermining their own cause

Despite the fact that Britain is pledged to reduce carbon emissions faster than most other leading economies, activists continue to cause mayhem on the roads, demanding even swifter action.

Yesterday, protesters from Just Stop Oil brought the M25 to a halt by climbing on overhead gantries, whereupon the police stopped traffic while they dealt with them.

The campaigners were in breach of a court order that they felt entitled to ignore. Their hysterical claims that a catastrophe is imminent are causing unfounded distress among young people.

While legitimate protest must be allowed in a free society, the activities of Just Stop Oil do not fall into that category. They are also self-defeating, since they alienate people otherwise sympathetic to the idea of lower carbon emissions.

Suella Braverman, the Home Secretary, condemned the group’s ""guerilla tactics"" and expressed her ""thoughts and best wishes"" to the injured officer.

Mr Harrington warned that the consequences in future could be even graver.

He said: ""I think it is only a matter of time before somebody gets killed.

""The only way this is going to stop is if Just Stop Oil frankly grow up and realise they are putting people's lives at risk.""

The police chief described being particularly incensed to see a spokesman for the protest group describe the collision as an ""awful situation"".

""I just want to really stress the point that Just Stop Oil are putting lives at risk,"" he said

""It's not an 'awful situation', it's a criminal situation.""

Braverman: 'It is not a civil liberty to stop ambulances getting to the sick'

Home Secretary Suella Braverman told police chiefs at a conference in Westminster

Although most police officers do an excellent job, sadly, in recent months and years we have seen an erosion of confidence in the police to take action against the radicals, the road-blockers, the vandals, the militants and the extremists.

But we have also seen the police appear to lose confidence in themselves; in yourselves. In your authority, in your power. An institutional reluctance. This must change.

Criminal damage, obstructing the highway, public nuisance – none of it should be humoured. It is not a human right to vandalise a work of art. It is not a civil liberty to stop ambulances getting to the sick and injured.

Such disruption is a threat to our way of life. It does not ‘further a cause’. It is not ‘freedom of expression’ and I want to reassure you that you have my – and this government’s – full backing in taking a firmer line to safeguard public order. Indeed, that is your duty.

Scenes of members of the public taking the law into their own hands are a sign of a loss of confidence and I urge you all to step up to your public duties in policing protests.

Suella Braverman condemns Just Stop Oil's M25 'guerilla tactics'

Suella Braverman has condemned Just Stop Oil's ""guerilla tactics"" after activists scaling gantries this morning led to a police officer being injured in a collision on the busy motorway.

The Home Secretary said: ""My thoughts and best wishes go to the Essex Police officer injured while dealing with protesters engaging in guerrilla tactics on the M25 today.

""These protests are dangerous and I fully back police in using all tools available to prevent further disruption and protect the public.""

An officer was injured in a ""serious"" incident after two lorries crashed with a police motorbike following road blocks put in place for the climate protesters.

Essex Police told The Telegraph: ""Initially officers intervened to deal with a protester on the motorway between Junction 26 and 27. Due to this a rolling road block was put in place.

""Subsequently, there was a collision involving two lorries and a police motorbike.

""Thankfully the motorbike rider has not been seriously injured.""

A Just Stop Oil spokesperson said the collision this morning was ""an awful situation"" but doubled down on their cause, adding: ""In normal circumstances this would be unacceptable"".

Met says they are dealing with JSO activists as quickly as possible

Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Mark Rowley said officers are dealing with Just Stop Oil (JSO) protesters as quickly as possible.

He said: ""We have gone as fast as we think we can do on the JSO issues.

""We can't take snipers apparently to people who are climbing the gantries, when we use the angle grinders we have to apparently just take off the locks, we can't take off the limbs at the same time.

""There are limits to how you can do this at speed. We are turning up at those things very quickly. We're going as quickly as we can.""

On Wednesday Met officers had to use an angle grinder to remove a bicycle D-lock from the neck of a protester who had attached themselves to a gantry, he said.

'Vital' that journalists are able to do job freely, No 10 says

Rishi Sunak believes it is ""vital"" that journalists are able to do their job freely, Downing Street has said following the arrest of a radio journalist while reporting on a Just Stop Oil protest.

Protest groups using 'dangerous' tactics, chair of NPCC says

Speaking to journalists after his conference speech, Martin Hewitt said some protest groups are increasingly using ""dangerous"" tactics.

""We are increasingly seeing things that are dangerous-dangerous for the protesters, dangerous for other members of the public and, as we've seen this morning, dangerous for police officers,"" he said.

""I just think that all of those groups, who have every right to make the point they want to make, have every right to seek to get that point through the media, need to think really hard about the responsibility that they have both to themselves, to other members of the public and to, as we've seen, police officers that are that are having to go there and try and deal with these very difficult circumstances.""

Two protesters charged following yesterday's M25 disruption

Two Just Stop Oil protesters have been charged over disruption on the M25, Essex Police has said.

Charlotte Kirin, 53, of Peckham Street, Bury St Edmunds, and 55 year-old Paul Bleach, of Locarno Road, Portsmouth, were charged with intentionally recklessly causing a public nuisance.

On Tuesday, they were arrested at junctions 31 and 27 of the M25 respectively.

Both are expected to appear at Westminster Magistrates' Court on Wednesday.

Hertfordshire Police say officers used 'professional judgement' in arresting journalist

Hertfordshire Police responded to the widespread criticism of the arrest of LBC reporter Charlotte Lynch, saying: ""As always, our priority remains to ensure public safety-we have a responsibility for the health and safety of all those involved and everyone at the scene, including emergency services, members of the public, members of the press and the protesters themselves.

""These operations are very fluid and fast moving, with the potential to cause widespread and sustained disruption, that not only affects Hertfordshire's stretch of the M25 but also the wider road networks.

""Our officers have been instructed to act as quickly as they can, using their professional judgment, to clear any possible protesters in order to get roads up and running and to prevent anyone from coming to harm.""

Speaking to journalists at a conference in Westminster on Wednesday, chairman of the National Police Chiefs' Council, Martin Hewitt, said officers are under pressure when dealing with protesters but media should not be prevented from reporting on them.

He said: ""There's an enormous amount of pressure in play around those protest issues for the reasons that you would understand.

""But, of course, there is a right for journalists to go and report on those occasions and that shouldn't be prevented in any way.""

Society of Editors 'strongly condemns' the arrest of journalists covering Just Stop Oil

The Society of Editors has said that it is deeply concerned and ""strongly condemns"" the arrest this week of journalists covering Just Stop Oil protests.

The Society’s intervention comes after LBC reporter Charlotte Lynch was arrested on Tuesday by Hertfordshire Police while covering a protest by the climate activist group.

Her arrest comes only a day after reports that officers from Hertfordshire constabulary had arrested documentary film maker Rich Felgate and photographer Tom Bowles on Monday. All had been covering protests by Just Stop Oil on the M25.

Responding to the arrests, Dawn Alford, Executive Director of the Society of Editors said: ""The Society is deeply concerned by reports this week of a number of journalists being arrested while reporting on protests by the campaign group Just Stop Oil.

""The protests are a source of legitimate public interest and journalists, film-makers and photographers have a right to attend protests and report on behalf of the public.

""We strongly condemn the arrest of journalists in the course of their work and will be writing to Hertfordshire Police to seek an urgent explanation and seek assurances that its officers respect the rights of journalists and understand that such actions threaten press freedom.""

Journalist tells of 'terrifying' five hours in cell after Just Stop Oil arrest

A radio journalist has spoken of the ""terrifying"" five hours she endured in a police cell after being arrested while reporting on a Just Stop Oil protest.

Charlotte Lynch, of LBC, had been reporting on the activists from a road bridge over junction 21 of the M25, in Hertfordshire, on Tuesday, for around 45 minutes when she was approached and questioned by two officers.

After showing them a press card and having explained she was reporting on the demonstration, the officers handcuffed her, took her phone and arrested her on conspiracy to commit a public nuisance.

It comes after a photographer and filmmaker said they were held in police custody for around 13 hours for covering a protest staged by the group.

Ms Lynch said she was searched on the side of the road, before officers seized her devices and took her to a police station in a custody van.

She said: ""Got to Stevenage police station, that journey took over an hour because of the M25 being closed.

""I was in the back of a police van, handcuffed, my hands were in front of me, handcuffed the entire time, on my own, the two police officers were behind the glass cage.

""That's when it dawned on me 'gosh, I could be charged here' and everything runs through your mind 'have I actually committed this offence?' even though I knew I hadn't.""

It was absolutely terrifying being in a cell with a pad for a bed in one corner and a metal toilet in the other. I was just doing my job. What’s also terrifying is what this means for press freedom. It was blindingly obvious I was a reporter. Thank you for the kind messages x

NPCC Chair: Policing is not anti-protest

The National Police Chiefs' Council Chair Martin Hewitt told an annual press conference:

This week we are seeing protests on the road network. A combination of proactivity and preparedness meant we have been able to reopen the busy motorways quickly.

Working with government and other agencies we continue to use civil injunctions as well as our criminal powers to minimise disruption.

Policing is not anti-protest, but it is pro-responsibility and for having due regard for the rights of others.

We will continue to take all appropriate action against anyone who deliberately chooses to protest outside of the law.

Telegraph View: The hysterical activists of Just Stop Oil are undermining their own cause

Despite the fact that Britain is pledged to reduce carbon emissions faster than most other leading economies, activists continue to cause mayhem on the roads, demanding even swifter action.

Yesterday, protesters from Just Stop Oil brought the M25 to a halt by climbing on overhead gantries, whereupon the police stopped traffic while they dealt with them.

The campaigners were in breach of a court order that they felt entitled to ignore. Their hysterical claims that a catastrophe is imminent are causing unfounded distress among young people.

While legitimate protest must be allowed in a free society, the activities of Just Stop Oil do not fall into that category. They are also self-defeating, since they alienate people otherwise sympathetic to the idea of lower carbon emissions.

The Metropolitan Police also said on Twitter: ""We're ready to respond to any protest activity on £M25 with partner forces again today.

Animal Rebellion joins JSO by climbing onto motorway gantries 'in multiple locations'

Just Stop Oil said around 10 of its supporters climbed onto overhead gantries in ""multiple locations"" on the M25 from 6.30am on Wednesday, in what is the third consecutive day of protests on the UK's busiest motorway.

They have been joined by activists from Animal Rebellion, a group campaigning for ""a plant-based food system"".

Officers were also at J30 of the M25, where one Just Stop Oil protester had climbed a gantry, while one person was stopped.

Just Stop Oil: 'The collision...is an awful situation'

A spokesperson from the group said:

The collision of two lorries and the injury of a police officer on the M25 this morning is an awful situation.

The level of disruption being witnessed on the M25 should not be happening-people are rightly angry and frustrated.

The impact on people's lives is huge. In normal circumstances this would be unacceptable.

It should never have come to this. The failure of our politics has left us with no other option as we seek to protect our rights and freedoms from a collapse in law and order due to a heating world.

The government can end this, immediately, by ending dirty new oil and gas.

The failure to abandon this toxic policy is a failure of politics and failure of leadership, it is a betrayal of us, our children and this country.

Our roads policing officers are dedicated, specialist officers who come to work to serve the public and keep you safe on our roads.

They do this tirelessly, day-in day-out.

""Sadly, this morning one of these fantastic officers has been injured while carrying out this work.

My thoughts are with them and their family.

I want to thank the public for their support, patience and understanding while we work to resolve this situation."
178,The Daily Telegraph,Broadsheet,2022,"Police can't 'arrest our way out' of Just Stop Oil protest, says senior officer","The country's most senior officer on policing protests has warned there will be no ""arresting our way out of"" the chaos caused by Just Stop Oil.

Chief Constable Chris Noble, who is the National Police Chiefs' Council (NPCC) protest lead, said: ""There's a fair challenge about how effectively we are dealing with these particular protests ... the answer to some of the challenges we face is not a policing answer.

""We're part of it but we're not going to arrest our way out of environmental protest.""

The defiant statement at the NPCC conference yesterday came after Suella Braverman told police to ""step up"" and take a “firmer line” against the protesters. The home secretary said there had also been a “loss in confidence” by police in their failure to make full use of their powers to crackdown on the protesters.

Activists are continuing to bring misery to thousands of motorists by blocking the M25 motorway every morning and have vowed to continue their campaign until the Government caves into its demands to stop issuing new oil and gas licences.

Chief Constable Noble said police are ""damned either way"", whether they are ""too soft"" or ""too robust"" on protesters.

""This is too important an area to be arrogant or complacent,"" he told the conference. ""What is the job of policing protest? The law does not make it clear, it is a matter of judgement for the police.

""We need to have a bit more of a conversation about what exactly do we want, considering we still live in [a] democracy, around expression rights.""

Tearful protesters have posted videos justifying their actions and claiming they have no choice but to take illegal action because the climate emergency means they will have no future.

But Lisa Townsend, the Police and Crime Commissioner for Surrey, whose force is one of those trying to tackle Just Stop Oil , suggested some of the protesters were being exploited by the organisers.

She described the group’s tactics as “chilling” and “sinister” and said there were parallels with grooming.

Movement 'takes on a sinister side'

Ms Townsend said: “I was speaking to an officer the other day who was about to go up on a gantry and he mentioned the word grooming which sounds very chilling. What these people are doing is going into colleges and universities and are targeting young people and are enticing them into a cause.

“That is where for me this movement takes on a sinister side. They appeal to youngsters who are vulnerable and perhaps lonely and make them feel as if they are a part of something.

“But it is like becoming part of a cult and for young people they perhaps don’t fully appreciate the long term implications of getting a criminal conviction in terms of them being able to travel and getting a job in the future.

“It is almost quasi-religious so they believe that any tactic is justified and that they have no choice but to do what they are doing no matter what the impact is on people’s lives.”

Just Stop Oil, which is a splinter group of Extinction Rebellion , began recruiting members at universities earlier this year, according to evidence uncovered by the Policy Exchange think tank.

Posters placed on campuses around the country warned students that climate change would lead to apocalyptic events.

One recruitment sign read: “The breakdown of the climate is destroying the economy. It will destroy your job, your family, this community, this town. It will lead to slaughter, war and mass starvation.

“It will be the biggest disaster in history. You can sit around and just let it happen or you can take responsibility to protect those you love.”

In a video posted online, Roger Hallam , who is accused of being one of the organisers of Just Stop Oil, gave an extraordinary prediction of the impact of climate change claiming it would result in rape and violence.

He said: “What will happen is that a group of young men will come into your home, they take your girlfriend, they take your mother, they put her onto the table and they gang rape her in front of you and then after that they take a hot stick and they poke out your eyes and they blind you that is the reality of the annihilation project that you face.”

Group likened to a cult

Dr Paul Stott, the head of extremism and security at the Policy Exchange, who produced a report on Just Stop Oil earlier this month, said the group was being run like a cult.

He said: “I am very concerned about the rhetoric and language used often by people in a position of authority in environmentalism or academia. The rhetoric is very doom and gloom all about the end of the world.

""Ultimately the activists are adults, they are making their own decisions but in an environment where there is an enormous amount of distinct propaganda and it is leading to some extreme behaviour.

""Just Stop Oil organisers have been pushing this argument that young people are having their future stolen from them.

""There is no responsibility being taken within the environmental movement around what the implications of this rhetoric are.""

On Thursday activists struck on the M25 for the fourth day running forcing the closure of the motorway around junction 8 in Surrey.

A spokesperson for Just Stop Oil said: ""If the government makes a statement announcing no new oil and gas licences then our young people can stop taking the action they are taking. They are being driven to act by government inaction.""

179,The Daily Telegraph,Broadsheet,2022,Meat and dairy set to banned at University of Stirling after student union vote,"Meat and dairy products are set to be banned on a university campus after students voted to go vegan.

Stirling University’s students union backed a move towards a plant-based menu at the three food outlets it controls, with activists to demand that the policy is adopted across the entire institution.

The campaign group Animal Rebellion, which has links to Extinction Rebellion , said the move was a UK-first and would help “address the climate and ecological emergencies” due to emissions linked to farming.

However, the Countryside Alliance branded it an “illogical” snub to Scottish farmers and called on the university to intervene to ensure a more democratic process. Only around 100 of the university’s 17,000 students took part in the vote.

“Obviously this is an attack on freedom of choice imposed by a tiny number of students on the wider student body,” Mo Metcalf-Fisher, spokesman for the Countryside Alliance, said.

“Stirling’s students’ union would be much better off sourcing sustainable local meat and dairy produce from Scottish farmers instead. How can an avocado flown in from South America have eco-superiority over a piece of grass fed beef from a local farm?

“Stirling University should demonstrate their support for Scottish farmers by ensuring they continue to supply meat and dairy, irrespective of what its students’ union decide to do.”

The university said that the vote would only affect outlets run by the students union and that it remained committed to offering “choice” at the catering facilities it controlled.

Talks with university

However, Imogen Robertson, a 21-year-old student at Stirling, said campaigners would be seeking talks with the university about imposing the meat and dairy ban across the campus.

“We won't be shying away from having the difficult conversations around the need for transitioning to a plant-based food system,” she said.

“We are planning to meet and discuss our campaign with the university itself and to push for the transition to plant-based catering to go further than just the student union.

“We know there is a lot of work to do but are prepared to work with all parties to facilitate this UK-first being a reality.”

The motion backed by students calls for the 50 per cent of products at the union to be plant-based by September next year, rising to 100 per cent by 2025.

A spokesman for the union said the move would have “a commercial implication” and that further scrutiny of the plan was needed. However, he said he was confident that “given the current policy we will be able to work positively with the motion’s direction as directed by our members.”

University of Edinburgh

In 2020, students at the University of Edinburgh rejected a ban on selling beef on campus, with 58 per cent of around 6,000 students voting against the proposal.

A spokesman for the University of Stirling said: “We are proud of the wide range of catering options we offer on campus, which includes the V-go vegan deli bar, and are committed to providing a choice on campus.

“This is a matter for the Students’ Union and doesn’t impact the University’s other catering options.”",Right,0,513,"Meat and dairy set to banned at University of Stirling after student union voteMeat and dairy products are set to be banned on a university campus after students voted to go vegan.

A spokesman for the University of Stirling said: “We are proud of the wide range of catering options we offer on campus, which includes the V-go vegan deli bar, and are committed to providing a choice on campus.

“This is a matter for the Students’ Union and doesn’t impact the University’s other catering options.”"
180,The Daily Telegraph,Broadsheet,2022,Climate protester who confronted David Attenborough in Michelin-starred restaurant arrested,"A climate-change protester has been arrested for trying to confront Sir David Attenborough as he dined at a Michelin-starred fish restaurant.

Emma Smart, an activist for the campaign group Animal Rebellion , allegedly caused a disturbance at the Catch at the Old Fish Market eatery in Weymouth, Dorset.

She was asked to leave the venue before being removed and detained by police.

In a statement later released by Mrs Smart, through Animal Rebellion, she said she targeted the restaurant as its “expensive menu was a symbol of excess and inequality”.

Mrs Smart, 45, approached Sir David’s table and tried to deliver a letter to him and have a five-minute chat about “telling the truth” about climate change.

She added: “We don’t need another documentary series showing us that we are losing, some 150 species going extinct globally every single day. What we need is action.”

Sir David, 96, had spent Thursday in the harbour town of Weymouth to film a TV documentary about fishing and went to the nearby restaurant in the evening.

Mrs Smart said: “The Catch is a symbol of excess and inequality in today’s world, Weymouth has average wages among the lowest in the UK and is at huge risk of sea level rises.

“Yet this restaurant still continues business as usual among the worst cost-of-living crisis many will ever experience.

“Sir David is in a unique position to tell the truth about the biodiversity crisis. He has the chance to leave a legacy of love, care, and of being the forerunner of a better world.”

Dorset Police said Mrs Smart, from Weymouth, was arrested after allegedly causing a disturbance and refusing to comply with officers after they asked her to leave the restaurant.

She was charged with failing to comply with a Section 35 direction and will appear at Weymouth Magistrates’ Court next month.

The Animal Rebellion group, an offshoot of Extinction Rebellion, said eight people entered the Nusr-Et steakhouse in the upmarket central London district at about 6pm and sat at tables which were already reserved.

Salt Bae , whose real name is Nusret Gokce and who shared a picture of himself at the World Cup on Friday, became a viral internet hit for his technique of sprinkling salt on to his dishes.

The protest group said in a press release it is calling for ""a plant-based food system and mass rewilding"".

Student Ben Thomas, 20, said: ""Restaurants like these are symbolic of a broken system.

""Whilst two million people are relying on food banks in the UK right now, influencer chefs are selling gold-plated steaks for more than £1,000.

""Steaks, and other red meats, that we know carry the highest environmental impacts.""

It comes weeks after a similar stunt at Gordon Ramsay's three-star Michelin restaurant in Chelsea.

On Saturday night, members of Animal Rebellion – a vegan off-shoot of Extinction Rebellion – staged a protest inside Heston Blumenthal’s Michelin-starred restaurant in Knightsbridge. In recent weeks, they’ve staged similar protests at Gordon Ramsay’s restaurant in Chelsea, and Nusr-Et, the astronomically expensive Knightsbridge restaurant that serves steaks costing £1,450. The protesters say they want an end to our “animal-based food system”, because it costs “the lives of billions of animals yearly”.

That may be so. But hang on. If these vegans want the public to stop eating meat, why do they only ever stage their protests inside restaurants hardly any of the public can afford to visit? Why don’t they stage them inside branches of McDonald’s, which serves vastly greater quantities of meat than Heston Blumenthal or Gordon Ramsay?

I think we can all guess why. It’s for the same reason that, during Animal Rebellion’s protests against dairy farming earlier in the year, they decided to tip milk all over the floor in Harrods, Selfridges and Fortnum & Mason, rather than, say, Asda or Lidl.

It’s because they’re terrified of the working class.

Staging a protest inside a Michelin-starred restaurant, they’ve clearly decided, is nice and safe. The well-heeled clientele will do no more than tut and roll their eyes.

Branches of McDonald’s, however, tend to have customers who are rather less well-heeled. And the vegan activists of Chelsea and Knightsbridge are scared stiff that, if they come between these frightfully rough-looking members of the lower orders and their dinner, they might turn nasty.

186,The Daily Mail,Tabloid,2019,HATRED ON THE MENU,"First the eco warriors shut down British cities. Now their militant vegan wing - with close links to the RSPCA - are opening a new battle front to stop us eating meat, fish and dairy... as this undercover report from the anarchists' training camp reveals

BY GUY ADAMS AND ALEX WARD

Friday night at a disused office building in central Newcastle, and two dozen men and women (plus one slightly shabby-looking pet dog) are busy fomenting what they like to call a people's revolution'.

They are finalising plans for a series of direct action' protests that will begin in London on Monday and end they hope with them forcing the Government to ban us all from eating meat, fish and dairy products.

Lovers of bacon butties, breakfast yoghurt, a milky coffee and juicy steaks might consider this to be dystopian science fiction, but the plan is deadly serious.

The group intends to bring parts of the capital to a halt over the next fortnight, shutting down a government ministry and disrupting the operations of major food companies along with London's biggest meat and fish markets.

In doing so they are prepared to be arrested.

One speaker says: It doesn't matter if you are the nice one who didn't want to get arrested, or you're the one at the front who did. Everyone who goes down there [to London] has to be aware of that, and make sure it's not going to be stopped by a few people getting pulled away [by the police].'

The group is called Animal Rebellion and its quest to force Britons into compulsory veganism is about to become very high profile. Over the coming days, the organisation is expected to bring thousands of supporters onto the streets, potentially causing serious disruption to the country's food supplies.

It's part of a wider wave of eco-protests organised by Extinction Rebellion, the group which presided over a botched attempt to use a fire engine to douse the Treasury building in Whitehall in fake blood on Thursday.

They are bringing a total of 20,000 activists to London next week, pledging to blockade London City Airport and shut roads around Westminster to protest against government inaction' on climate change. Around 4,400 volunteers are willing to be arrested, with half said to be prepared to go to prison.

Animal Rebellion, an extremist faction of Extinction Rebellion which wants all animal farming and fishing banned, also plans to occupy' both Smithfield and Billingsgate markets from which many of London's restaurants and takeaways source their meat and fish.

A blockade is not only planned for the Whitehall headquarters of the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) but also unspecified facilities belonging to two of the UK's largest meat firms, Cargill and JBS.

Other targets are said to include the City offices of Red Tractor (the farm and food assurance scheme that provides traceable, safe food) because it has certified British meat products as responsibly' sourced.

Policing the last Rebellion' in April cost the Metropolitan Police £16 million more police resources than the Grenfell Tower disaster and London Bridge terror attack combined.

With this in mind, Friday's gathering in Newcastle, one of scores that have been held around the UK in recent weeks, saw Animal Rebellion protesters trained in how to cause maximum disruption to the police and public while avoiding the most serious criminal sanctions.

For a blockade or an obstruction of the highway, the police can only hold you for 24 hours,' explained the main speaker, Jane Tredgett.

They're going to put you away for a maximum of 24  hours, release you, and then it will go to court several months later. Usually, you'll get a couple of hundred pounds in fines and a smack on the wrist, and maybe a restraining order if you've done it a few times in terms of where you can go and where you can't go.'

Sipping cups of tea (with soy or almond milk, of course), the vegan activists in Newcastle sat through a lengthy presentation by Tredgett on the urgent' need for government bans on animal farming and fishing.

It culminated in a minute's silence' for a beef cow called Hero, which hit the headlines last year after escaping a Polish abattoir but died after being recaptured.

They then held a series of role-play exercises to educate them in non-violent direct action.' They were advised to respond to any question from a police officer by refusing to comment. If there's an attempt at an arrest, they are advised to make their whole body go limp, which makes the job of the police officer much trickier.

Tredgett, who says she has signed up to be arrestable', also urged supporters to make an online declaration that they were conscientious protectors' whose potential crimes were politically motivated.

Her thinking is that it shows you haven't got swept up in the moment and said, “Oh, this looks like fun . . . I'll sit here and superglue myself as well”, but that you've consciously thought that you want to do it'. She added helpfully: Some judges take that into account.'

One of the principal beliefs behind Animal Rebellion's campaign is that meat and fish products have a greater carbon footprint than vegetables. It's argued that about 7kg of carbon dioxide is emitted in the production of a day's food for someone on a meat-rich diet, whereas it's just 4kg for a vegetarian or 3kg for a vegan. Thus veganism is the only way to prevent environmental catastrophe.

This belief vigorously disputed by the National Farmers' Union among others has gained momentum with, for example, Cambridge University which removed beef and lamb from its menus in 2016.

Animal Rebellion compares its efforts to ban meat, fish and dairy products (plus, one must assume, leather) to the 19th-century campaign against slavery. They say they are following in the footsteps of a long list of people including Martin Luther King and Mahatma Gandhi.

We declare rebellion against the Government and the animal agriculture and fishing industries,' they say. We are not simply here to disrupt . . . For the sake of all life, these industries must end.'

Not put off by this extravagant (and arguably alarmist) rhetoric, Animal Rebellion has the support of several wealthy animal charities around the world, including the celebrity-friendly Peta.

As we'll explain, it also counts among its founders several veteran campaigners with long-held connections to organisations such as the Green Party and RSPCA.

Like some key players in the so-called deep green' movement, many activists have an unusual view of traditional democracy endorsing Extinction Rebellion's demand for a citizens' assembly' of people chosen by random lottery to replace Parliament in deciding environmental policy and affection for Momentum-style far-Left politics.

One of Animal Rebellion's most oft-repeated slogans is: Kill capitalism, not animals'.

Animal Rebellion was created in June when representatives of 20 animal rights groups including The Vegan Society, Peta, and vegan charity Viva! met to discuss a campaign of non-violent civil disobedience' that would force the Government to end the industries of animal agriculture and fishing and [lead] a transition to a sustainable and just plant-based food system'.

The meeting was not entirely cordial. Some centrist organisations who attended appear to have walked out half-way through in protest at what they saw as the organisers' extremism. Among them was the Animal Interfaith Alliance (AIA), a coalition of religious animal rights groups whose chief executive Barbara Gardner is also a trustee of the RSPCA.

A representative from AIA went along to find out more about the movement. However, when it became clear that Animal Rebellion's tactics included civil disobedience, our representative left the meeting,' says Gardner.

Shortly afterwards, Animal Rebellion was incorporated at Companies House. Its two directors are Dan Kidby, a 27-year-old from Lancaster who describes himself as a pro-intersectional vegan anarchist', and Mark Westcombe, a 49-year-old lecturer at Lancaster University, who is listed as a Green Party local election candidate.

Although the Green Party policy does not (yet) include banning consumption of meat and fish, Westcombe is not the only senior member who appears to boast links to Animal Rebellion.

Media coverage of the group's first public protest, when it briefly closed London's Trafalgar Square in August, quoted its campaigns officer in Waltham Forest, Mark Dawes, saying: If we are to stop climate change and the damage to our environment, we need to move towards a plant-based diet.'

Other key figures in Animal Rebellion's campaign for compulsory veganism are Roger Hallam, a veteran political activist recently in custody over an alleged plot to use drones to disrupt Heathrow airport, and Tim Speers, a 33-year-old from Beckenham arrested a few days ago while filming himself spray-painting the slogan animal emergency = crime against humanity' on the walls of the Old Bailey.

Then there is Jane Tredgett, 52, who works in executive training and runs the group's direct action' training programme.

For almost 18 years, she has had a seat on the RSPCA's ruling council, an elected group of trustees in charge of the charity's policy and strategy as well as allocation of its £130 million-a-year budget. Until recently, she was the charity's vice-chair.

After the Mail asked questions about her links to Animal Rebellion, the RSPCA, which had for years denied claims that its ruling council has been dominated by extremists, announced her resignation. However, she was allowed to remain in place until the end of last month for continuity', sparking complaints from at least four fellow trustees.

Yet, even now, as she orchestrates a direct action campaign to ban us from eating meat and fish, Mrs Tredgett seems likely to continue to exert significant influence over the RSPCA. For according to ballot papers for a forthcoming election in which RSPCA members will select a new board of nine trustees, Mrs Tredgett is registered as an official supporter' of eight of the 11 candidates.

One of these is Jose Parry, a founding director of Humane Being, a non-profit group set up by Tredgett to campaign for animal rights (he resigned in March). In recent months, the organisation (which until last week had another former RSPCA trustee, Bob Baylis, as a director), has devoted almost all of its resources to campaigning for Animal Rebellion.

All of which brings us to Monday's protest at Smithfield.

Although originally conceived as a ten-day direct action' to shut London's biggest meat market for the duration, a decision was made on Thursday to scale back the protest to 24 hours amid fears that it might lead to violent clashes and cause economic hardship to mostly working-class stallholders.

Instead, Animal Rebellion urged supporters to target Defra, which they hope to close for at least two days on Tuesday and Wednesday, before focusing on meat giants Cargill and JBS (on Thursday) and Billingsgate fish market on Friday, when the capital's restaurants are attempting to source supplies for the weekend.

The decision to extend from Smithfield, rather than shutting it down for duration has, however, caused disquiet among Animal Rebellion's activists: many believing this is a betrayal of the group's values, and they have pledged to cause havoc at the meat market.

Making sure there will be no disruption to the selling of dead bodies is not what I was expecting, and I'm definitely not in favour of supporting the idea,' was one posting on the group's social media page. You are utter scum working with animal abusers,' declared another.

Whether they get their wish, of course, remains to be seen. But this is only the beginning.

For Animal Rebellion is organised, and well-funded, and has strong links to some of the most powerful political organisations and charities in the land.

So as thousands of angry protesters once more descend on London, we should be in no doubt: these people are coming for our Sunday roast.",Right- Extreme,0,1926,"HATRED ON THE MENUFirst the eco warriors shut down British cities. Now their militant vegan wing - with close links to the RSPCA - are opening a new battle front to stop us eating meat, fish and dairy... as this undercover report from the anarchists' training camp reveals

BY GUY ADAMS AND ALEX WARD

Friday night at a disused office building in central Newcastle, and two dozen men and women (plus one slightly shabby-looking pet dog) are busy fomenting what they like to call a people's revolution'.

They are finalising plans for a series of direct action' protests that will begin in London on Monday and end they hope with them forcing the Government to ban us all from eating meat, fish and dairy products.

Lovers of bacon butties, breakfast yoghurt, a milky coffee and juicy steaks might consider this to be dystopian science fiction, but the plan is deadly serious.

The group intends to bring parts of the capital to a halt over the next fortnight, shutting down a government ministry and disrupting the operations of major food companies along with London's biggest meat and fish markets.

In doing so they are prepared to be arrested.

One speaker says: It doesn't matter if you are the nice one who didn't want to get arrested, or you're the one at the front who did. Everyone who goes down there [to London] has to be aware of that, and make sure it's not going to be stopped by a few people getting pulled away [by the police].'

The group is called Animal Rebellion and its quest to force Britons into compulsory veganism is about to become very high profile. Over the coming days, the organisation is expected to bring thousands of supporters onto the streets, potentially causing serious disruption to the country's food supplies.

It's part of a wider wave of eco-protests organised by Extinction Rebellion, the group which presided over a botched attempt to use a fire engine to douse the Treasury building in Whitehall in fake blood on Thursday.

They are bringing a total of 20,000 activists to London next week, pledging to blockade London City Airport and shut roads around Westminster to protest against government inaction' on climate change. Around 4,400 volunteers are willing to be arrested, with half said to be prepared to go to prison.

Animal Rebellion, an extremist faction of Extinction Rebellion which wants all animal farming and fishing banned, also plans to occupy' both Smithfield and Billingsgate markets from which many of London's restaurants and takeaways source their meat and fish.

A blockade is not only planned for the Whitehall headquarters of the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) but also unspecified facilities belonging to two of the UK's largest meat firms, Cargill and JBS.

Other targets are said to include the City offices of Red Tractor (the farm and food assurance scheme that provides traceable, safe food) because it has certified British meat products as responsibly' sourced.

Policing the last Rebellion' in April cost the Metropolitan Police £16 million more police resources than the Grenfell Tower disaster and London Bridge terror attack combined.

With this in mind, Friday's gathering in Newcastle, one of scores that have been held around the UK in recent weeks, saw Animal Rebellion protesters trained in how to cause maximum disruption to the police and public while avoiding the most serious criminal sanctions.

For a blockade or an obstruction of the highway, the police can only hold you for 24 hours,' explained the main speaker, Jane Tredgett.

They're going to put you away for a maximum of 24  hours, release you, and then it will go to court several months later. Usually, you'll get a couple of hundred pounds in fines and a smack on the wrist, and maybe a restraining order if you've done it a few times in terms of where you can go and where you can't go.'

Sipping cups of tea (with soy or almond milk, of course), the vegan activists in Newcastle sat through a lengthy presentation by Tredgett on the urgent' need for government bans on animal farming and fishing.

It culminated in a minute's silence' for a beef cow called Hero, which hit the headlines last year after escaping a Polish abattoir but died after being recaptured.

They then held a series of role-play exercises to educate them in non-violent direct action.' They were advised to respond to any question from a police officer by refusing to comment. If there's an attempt at an arrest, they are advised to make their whole body go limp, which makes the job of the police officer much trickier.

Tredgett, who says she has signed up to be arrestable', also urged supporters to make an online declaration that they were conscientious protectors' whose potential crimes were politically motivated.

Her thinking is that it shows you haven't got swept up in the moment and said, “Oh, this looks like fun . . . I'll sit here and superglue myself as well”, but that you've consciously thought that you want to do it'. She added helpfully: Some judges take that into account.'

One of the principal beliefs behind Animal Rebellion's campaign is that meat and fish products have a greater carbon footprint than vegetables. It's argued that about 7kg of carbon dioxide is emitted in the production of a day's food for someone on a meat-rich diet, whereas it's just 4kg for a vegetarian or 3kg for a vegan.

195,The Daily Mail,Tabloid,2022,Why is the law still indulging these eco lunatics? Just Stop It,"TWO busy motorway service stations on the southern stretch of the M25 were the latest targets of the Just Stop Oil eco-mentalists yesterday.

Self-styled 'saviours' of the planet used hammers and spray paint to disable petrol pumps at the start of the morning rush hour.

They stuck themselves to the forecourt entrance to prevent drivers filling up, while the first police on the scene just stood and watched.

Again. One 'protester' who superglued his hand to a diesel pump developed cramp in his arm.

Poor lamb. The Old Bill looked on as his partners in crime wheeled a chair for him to sit on. Still, what else have we come to expect?

When XR staged a sit-down demo on the northern section of the M25, a senior officer asked them if there was anything she could bring them. A few cushions, perhaps? A nice cup of tea and a packet of Hobnobs?

And to hell with the thousands of motorists condemned to spend hours in an interminable traffic jam; the missed flights, doctors' appointments and business meetings; the ambulances unable to reach hospitals; the sheer aggravation adding to the everyday stresses of life.

Yesterday's wanton vandalism closed the busy service areas at Clacket Lane and Cobham in Surrey for hours. The only surprise was that Plod didn't fetch one of those mini battering rams they use for bashing down doors from the boot of their patrol car and lend a hand.

Go, go, go! Or rather, don't.

POLICE chiefs appear to see their job as facilitating even the most fatuous and disruptive 'protests', not serving the wider public who pay their wages by keeping the Queen's highways open.

Would they be so indulgent if this, say, had been a gang of Millwall supporters venting their frustration at a 1-0 away defeat by destroying a few petrol pumps?

What do you think? They'd be scrambling the riot squad, all batons blazing and cracking skulls as a basis for negotiation. And rightly so.

It's not as if this bunch of XR spin-off headbangers wasn't 'known to police'. They included a couple of clowns with plenty of previous, including tethering themselves to goalposts during Premier League matches at Everton and Tottenham.

One of them has already been jailed for a month and a half for blocking the M25 last October. Not nearly long enough. Deportation would have been a better option. I hear Rwanda is nice this time of year.

Despite the attention they receive and the widespread disruption they cause, these lunatics are few in number and speak for nobody but themselves.

Yet as I wrote recently, they have been allowed to succeed in bringing much of Britain to a standstill where Arthur Scargill's flying pickets during the year-long miners' strike failed miserably.

The difference, of course, was that back then the Old Bill, under orders from the Government, sent in the heavy mob. Today, the police roll out the red carpet and send along the skateboard squad to join in the fun.

This Rag, Tag and Bobtail collection of full-time agitators operates under assorted flags of convenience, from Insulate Britain to Animal Rebellion. They are not legitimate protesters, they're nihilists.

They have no serious goals, other than self-indulgence and a despicable determination to cause as much misery as possible to their fellow citizens. Most of them are serial offenders, freed time and again by the courts to commit further acts of criminal damage and public nuisance.

Even when the police can be bothered to arrest them, the courts are guaranteed to treat them with extreme leniency.

For instance, in September 2020 Extinction Rebellion stopped millions of newspapers being delivered by blockading the gates of print works on Merseyside and in Hertfordshire for 11 hours.

This selfish action prevented 1,100 shops receiving copies of the Daily Mail, The Sun and The Daily Telegraph, costing publishers £1.2million at a time when sales were already badly hit by Covid.

Lest you think this is special pleading on behalf of my trade, consider the effect on family newsagents struggling to stay solvent, delivery workers deprived of a day's income and readers denied their daily paper.

Not to mention the outrageous attempt to silence our Free Press. Yet again, the police just stood back and let them get on with it. And this week, when two of these fanatics finally appeared in court, charged with obstruction, they walked away laughing in our faces.

The women involved were let off with a conditional discharge and ordered to pay £600 prosecution costs plus a £22 'victim surcharge'. Whatever happened to the punishment fitting the crime?

This pathetic sentence hardly reflected the scale of the knock-on effects, let alone the cost. Where did the court come up with the £600 figure? You won't find many lawyers who'll get out of bed for six hundred quid. It'll cost more than that to heat the court for the day.

As for the £22 victim surcharge, don't make me laugh. A speeding ticket will cost you five times that.

How does less than the price of a round of drinks these days compensate publishers for a £1.2million hit? Not to mention the revenue lost by newsagents, garages and convenience stores.

Yet this kind of pathetic, kid-gloves mollycoddling is only too typical of the softly-softly approach towards anarchic eco-maniacs and others of a woke ilk by the alleged forces of law and order. Claiming to have a fashionable cause means never having to say sorry.

Compare and contrast the sentence handed down to the XR print works pickets with the hardline treatment of a frustrated businesswoman in Southend who nudged a couple of Insulate Britain demonstrators with her car.

They were blocking the road, stopping her getting to work and taking her 11-year-old son to school. Even though no one was hurt and she couldn't have been doing more than two miles per hour, she was charged with dangerous driving and had her licence suspended pending sentencing on May 6.

That'll teach her to drive an £80,000 Range Rover.

FACE it, the police and those responsible for running the criminal justice system are no longer on the side of the law-abiding, tax-paying majority in this country.

They have all been captured by the Left-wing Common Purpose conspiracy which infests every branch of so-called 'public service' and is hell-bent on furthering 'progressive' interests, including militant environmentalism.

What's the betting that if and when the idiots behind yesterday's vandalism and disruption eventually appear before the courts, they'll be released immediately back on to the streets, with a pound from the poor box, to continue their deranged campaign of unapologetic criminality?

These ego-centric exhibitionists - in their designer hair-shirt, hi-viz vests - care more about the bloody polar bears than other human beings.

Do they really imagine that even a Government that bends the knee to every passing woke bandwagon is going to get rid of fossil fuels by tea-time, especially in the midst of a worldwide energy crisis and the looming threat of nuclear war?

They are more like a rip-roaring bonkers, Waco-style religious cult than a legitimate pressure group with tangible aims.

If there was any real justice in the world, they'd all be locked away in a padded cell wearing a jacket which does up at the back.

Maybe then, they'd Just Stop It.

196,The Daily Mail,Tabloid,2022,How DID animal rights mob get through cordon?; Activists jump barriers and run past police into path of military band,"VEGAN demonstrators breached security to storm The Mall and disrupt yesterday's celebrations.

Despite a huge police presence and 200 soldiers on the route in central London, dozens of activists jumped barriers and ran into the path of a military band.

Several from the animal rights climate change group Animal Rebellion made it to the centre of The Mall where they lay in the path of the Massed Bands of the Household Division while other protesters filmed them and waved placards.

There were boos and shouts of 'Fools!' as police dragged them away and led them off in handcuffs shortly after 10am.

Members of the group appear to have evaded police lining the route by leaping the barriers from both sides simultaneously at points where only one officer was nearby.

One activist wore a gold plastic crown over his hat. Another carried a placard saying 'Reclaim royal land' as they tried to disrupt the Queen's birthday parade.

The band continued to march uninterrupted, barely missing a step as police ran in between them to grab the demonstrators. Animal Rebellion said 25 of its supporters were involved in the disruption. Last year it dyed the fountains outside Buckingham Palace red to protest against Crown land being used in meat and dairy farming, and in hunting and fishing. It has called on the Royal Family to rewild all Crown land.

The group, which is linked to the climate change group Extinction Rebellion, describes itself as a 'mass volunteer movement using non-violent civil disobedience to help the transition to a plant-based food system'.

It tweeted: 'Animal Rebels disrupt the Queen's Platinum Jubilee celebrations demanding royal land is reclaimed.

'This summer we're taking bigger action against the dairy industry than ever before, and we need you.' One of the protesters was named by the group as Beau King Houston, a former music and drama student from Glasgow who reportedly worked as an assistant manager at the jeweller Tiffany & Co and as a drag act called Silver Summers.

Mr Houston, whose Twitter profile describes him as a media personality and role model, said: 'The Royal Family has had decades to lead the way on a just transition to plant-based farming and has failed to do so.'

Another appeared to be former airline pilot Todd Smith, 33, who has since become a spokesman for

Extinction Rebellion and has joined several of their demonstrations. Robert Gordon, a spokesman for the group, said: 'These Jubilee celebrations are set to cost the taxpayer tens, if not hundreds, of millions of pounds.

'All whilst we are struggling through the cost-of-living crisis and families across the country are increasingly reliant on food banks. Instead, this obscene amount of money could have been used to provide instant food security and kick-start a plant-based future where no child is left hungry or terrified by climate collapse. We must reclaim royal land for this.'

The group posted a video showing two of its supporters in handcuffs. One of the men said he had been arrested for 'taking action on climate change', adding: 'That's why we are in handcuffs today.'

He added: 'The Royal Family claims they care a lot about the climate crisis. A first step to show that to be true would be to rewild their land and move it away from animal agriculture, which is destroying all our futures.'

The Metropolitan Police said 12 people were arrested for obstructing the highway, for which the penalty is a fine. It added: 'Thank you to the crowd who showed their support by clapping our officers who returned to their post after dealing with the incident swiftly.'

199,The Daily Mail,Tabloid,2022,Holy cow! Milk shortage fears amid eco mob siege,"FEARS of a milk shortage have been triggered after vegan protesters blockaded some of the UK's biggest dairy processors yesterday.

Animal Rebellion arrived at dawn at Arla and Muller plants to block shipments of milk and other dairy products.

The vegan protest group, who oppose animal farming, stopped company trucks before climbing on to them, as others trespassed company facilities, scaling milk silos and loading bays. The blockade included the UK's biggest dairy distribution centre near Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, which is owned by Arla, plus three plants run by Muller, at Droitwich, Severnside, and Bridgwater.

The protest group, an off-shoot of Extinction Rebellion, admits defying a High Court injunction recently obtained by Arla to stop the protests. It said its supporters will continue to take non-violent direct action until the Government supports moves away from animal farming and fishing with a transition to a plant-based system.

The injunction sought by Arla to stop the protests warned that if the action lasts for two weeks 'it is inevitable there will be milk shortages on supermarket shelves'.

Yesterday Arla said production is currently running as normal, adding: 'We have protesters at our Aylesbury site and are working closely with local police to resolve the situation.' And Muller UK &

200,The Daily Mail,Tabloid,2022,We law-abiding folk need our own protest group to stop this eco mob,"DOES anyone else feel like setting up a peaceful protest group called Just Stop Activists, to demand that the police, courts and other authorities finally start taking decisive action against illegal methods of protest?

The first move would be to chain ourselves to whatever vehicles the likes of Animal Rebellion are using to get to the nation's dairy plants before they can blockade them and disrupt the supply of milk to supermarkets.

Yet again, a Left-wing pressure group is threatening to disrupt people going about their lawful, everyday lives - and yet again it looks as if they are going to get away with it.

Dairies run by Arla and Muller have been targeted by Animal Rebellion, an Extinction Rebellion off-shoot which thinks the entire country should be forced to adopt a vegan diet and has vowed to block the supply of milk in order to further its objectives.

If the protests are allowed to continue, the companies have warned, we will have milk shortages within a fortnight - a misery for families and households already paring back their weekly shop.

To be fair to the police, 31 protesters were arrested at the Arla distribution centre. But we know from depressing past experience what to expect next: the same protesters will be back at the site within hours, having been released without charge.

It was left to Arla, by the way, to obtain a High Court injunction to stop the activists closing down their facilities.

By contrast, the Government dillied and dallied for weeks before issuing injunctions against a similar group of protesters, Insulate Britain, for blocking roads.

I will defend to the death the right to protest, even when the beliefs of the protesters are in direct opposition to my own. But the actions in which these groups are engaged are not protests. They are acts of obstruction and vandalism by mainly privileged egotists.

Just last month we had the frustrating sight of activists from Just Stop Oil blocking the entrances to petrol stations and smashing pumps, untroubled by the police.

The Met eventually arrested 43 but the damage had been done.

During Extinction Rebellion's encampment of Oxford Circus - in the heart of London's main shopping thoroughfare - police were filmed dancing alongside the protesters. Unfathomably, the jamboree in April 2019 - centred on a pink yacht - was allowed to continue for a fortnight.

What is so extraordinary is that these lax attitudes seem to apply only to green protesters.

Councils have no problem, for example, designating exclusion zones where anti-abortion protesters must not unfurl their banners - even in peaceful protest. But smash up petrol pumps and sit in the middle of road in the name of fighting climate change and you seem to be untouchable.

Green protests have grown ever more audacious because they have been met with such feeble policing. Activists know they wouldn't get away with it in other countries - even ones with strong environmental sympathies.

In February, when members of a group calling itself the Uprising of the Last Generation glued themselves to roads around Germany, protesting at food waste, security officials were unequivocal. 'To massively impede people's mobility or block the movement of goods is a serious breach of the law,' Bavaria's chief security officer told the protesters. Even the German Green party was quick to condemn their actions.

PROTESTERS who tried to block flights departing from Malmo airport in Sweden were swiftly arrested and charged with airport robbery. And when, in 2019, Extinction Rebellion activists tried blocking the Pont de Sully bridge in Paris, they were teargassed by the gendarmes.

I simply do not understand why these illegal forms of direct action are indulged in Britain. Groups such as Extinction Rebellion aren't even causing mayhem without notice. They are proudly announcing what they intend to do, and where and when they intend to do it.

Yet every time, police seem to act as if they have been caught out. And even when they do finally reach the scene they seem to stand back - as if they believe that to intervene would somehow be an improper use of their powers.

It is a very serious business when a political group sets out deliberately to disrupt the supply of food. Society cannot function if everyone with a grudge is allowed to commit acts of sabotage and obstruction.

201,The Daily Mail,Tabloid,2022,Vegan activists drill holes in milk lorry tyres,"VEGAN activists blockaded depots and sabotaged tankers as attempts to trigger a national milk shortage entered a second day yesterday.

Zealots from Animal Rebellion - an offshoot of militant group Extinction Rebellion - broke into dairy processing plants at 3am yesterday to drill holes in the tyres of delivery lorries and fill their exhaust pipes with expanding foam.

Activists also tried to block the streets outside the Queen Elizabeth II conference centre in Westminster hours before Liz Truss was named new Tory leader.

The blockade included the UK's biggest dairy distribution centre near Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, which is owned by Arla, plus three plants run by Muller - near Droitwich, Stonehouse and Bridgwater.

The vegan protesters, who oppose animal farming, forced the dairy giants'

trucks to stop before climbing on to them, as others trespassed at company facilities to scale milk silos and loading bays.

Thames Valley Police said it made four arrests at the Aylesbury site yesterday, after 27 protesters were arrested for blockading the complex on Sunday.

At 3am, vegans drilled holes in lorry tyres at the Muller plant at Hampton Lovett, near Droitwich, Worcestershire. West Mercia Police said it had made 21 arrests for aggravated trespassing offences. Assistant Chief Constable Richard Cooper said: 'We respect the right to peaceful protest, but we will take proportionate action when the law is broken.'

Further protests took place at a Muller site near Bridgwater in Somerset, with 15 arrests. Eight were held at the Severnside site near Stonehouse, Gloucestershire.

203,The Daily Mail,Tabloid,2022,"UK comes to a standstill

","PREMIER League football matches and the Last Night of the Proms are among the sporting and cultural events cancelled out of respect for the late Queen - as even environmental protesters suspended planned disruptions.

As Britain came to a halt yesterday to remember Elizabeth II's 70 years of service, attractions such as Legoland in Windsor, London Zoo, Kew Gardens and Historic Royal Palaces' six sites, including the Tower of London, were closed out of respect.

Luxury food and fashion retailer Selfridges, which has a royal warrant to supply the Queen food and household goods, did not open its stores in Birmingham, Manchester and London. Liberty, Mulberry and French Connection were also closed.

The Government said there was no obligation for events or sporting fixtures to be cancelled, or for entertainment venues to be closed, during the period of national mourning which began yesterday.

But official guidance released by the Cabinet Office suggested organisations may wish to consider cancelling or postponing events or closing venues on the day of the state funeral 'as a mark of respect'.

Soon after the guidance was released, the Premier League announced all weekend fixtures would be cancelled, following the lead of the English Football League. All Welsh, Northern Irish and professional Scottish football was also postponed, along with England's National League, FA Trophy and even grassroots fixtures as the national game paid its respects.

Premiership rugby fixtures will go ahead today - although yesterday's two matches were postponed - while cricket will also resume at all levels.

Play was suspended for the day at golf's BMW PGA Championship on Thursday, with no play yesterday. But the event will resume at Wentworth today. And horseracing, the Queen's favourite sport, will return tomorrow after the British Horseracing Authority cancelled events on Thursday evening, yesterday and today.

The BBC announced that the Last Night Of The Proms has been cancelled as a mark of respect. The conclusion of the eight-week summer season of daily classical music concerts, which takes place predominantly in the Royal Albert Hall in central London, was due to conclude tonight.

Some questioned why the performances couldn't go ahead as a celebration of the Queen's life.

Journalist Russell Davies, who hosts Radio 4's Brain of Britain quiz, tweeted that it was a 'poor decision', adding: 'National mourning surely shouldn't silence music.' Extinction Rebellion, whose actions blocking roads have previously paralysed the capital, said its plan to illegally occupy Hyde Park this weekend was cancelled 'until further notice'.

Its sister group Animal Rebellion said its plans were also on hold, while even anti-monarchy pressure group Republic said it would not campaign. The TUC Congress, due to be held in Brighton from tomorrow, was postponed.

204,The Daily Mail,Tabloid,2022,Still milking it: Fortnum vandals nabbed as they join the Animal Rebellion rabbles,"TWO vegan activists who poured milk over the floor in Selfridges and Fortnum & Mason were arrested by police yesterday as hundreds of eco-agitators daubed paint on shops, closed off roads and caused havoc across London.

Officers detained Sofia Fernandes Pontes, 26, a student from the Portuguese island of Madeira, and Steve Bone, 40, a photographer from Essex, after picking them out of the crowd.

Their arrests came more than 24 hours after a video of them spilling milk inside the luxury department stores went viral on the internet.

However, police failed to stop protesters armed with white and red paint cans targeting a branch of McDonald's and running riot inside two hunting and fishing shops.

Critics last night questioned why officers were unable to prevent the criminal damage given Animal

Rebellion had warned days in advance that it planned to 'unleash playful disruption across the city'.

Last night Susan Hall, chair of the Police and Crime Committee at the

Greater London Authority, said: 'It seems these people are given carte blanche to do whatever they want.'

Meanwhile, some 300 protesters blocked Westminster Bridge near

Parliament and ignored police pleas to leave the area for almost three hours until officers finally started making arrests.

It brought to an end a day of mayhem in the capital, as other demonstrations by Just Stop Oil, campaigners calling for WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange to be freed from jail and protesters for women's rights in Iran all marched on Central London at the same time.

Police said 27 Animal Rebellion activists had been arrested, as well as 24 Just Stop Oil campaigners who had blocked London roads yesterday morning for the eighth day in a row.

Officers also arrested a man and two women found with fire extinguishers filled with paint after their car was stopped in West London.

A Scotland Yard spokesman said: 'Officers have been closely monitoring the main body of protesters as they moved around Central London, preventing offences and making arrests where necessary.

'There have been three instances of criminal damage to retail and restaurant premises. These were carried out by small groups who were not with the main protest group at the time of the incidents.

Fresh-faced activists from ecogroup Animal Rebellion targeted Harrods, Fortnum & Mason, Whole Foods, Waitrose and M&S stores, calling for a 'plant-based future'.

It was the second weekend in a row that eco-warriors have impacted on shoppers, with stores hit in London, Manchester, Norwich and Edinburgh.

Last night, furious Home Secretary Suella Braverman called on the police to 'do a better job' as she announced a crackdown on the ecoactivists in a blistering article for The Mail on Sunday.

She lambasted protesters for their 'imagined right to bully' the rest of the public, adding: 'Who do they think they are? I can tell them that if they think they're above the law, they're sorely mistaken.'

Protesters dumped milk over the meat counter at Harrods and vandalised the cheese counter at Fortnum & Mason, which was targeted by the same group last weekend.

One worker in Fortnum & Mason said: 'I was trying to serve customers and they came and started pouring milk everywhere.'

A cheesemonger at Whole Foods in Piccadilly, Central London, said: 'They just walked in, chucked milk and poured it all over, ruining lots of butter and £500 worth of fish.

'They got out before we could call the police. I don't know what they think they've achieved.'

A staff member at Waitrose in

Belgravia said: 'There were six protesters and they came and stood on the meat counter. They poured yogurt pots and milk and it formed this mushy mixture down the whole meat aisle, it was a real hazard.

'We called the police and they escorted them out the shop. I don't know if they were arrested.'

207,The Daily Mail,Tabloid,2022,Just 1 in 4 milk-dumping protesters held by police,"POLICE chiefs were last night facing calls to take tougher action against eco zealots after it emerged that only a quarter of Animal Rebellion's milk-pouring protesters have been arrested.

The fanatics have been causing havoc in department stores and supermarkets in recent weeks by storming in and dumping milk, demanding the Government works towards 'a plant-based future'.

About 30 activists have targeted shops around the country. There have been protests at Harrods, Fortnum and Mason and Selfridges in London, a Waitrose store in Edinburgh and branches of M&S in Manchester and Norwich. Analysis by The Mail on Sunday identified 18 activists who took part in London's protests. Yet the Metropolitan Police have arrested and charged only three people.

Police in Edinburgh made no arrests despite footage of the Waitrose protest being viewed more than 14million times on Twitter.

208,The Daily Mail,Tabloid,2022,DEAR READER,"TRAVEL, at its most basic, is about getting from A to B. And right now in Britain, it's impossible to go anywhere without the fear it will take double the time. There were no train strikes this week but the London Underground was closed on Thursday, bringing the capital to a standstill.

I came into town on a train from East Sussex. The taxi queue at Victoria Station snaked its way back and forth but even those at the front faced going nowhere in a hurry. Buses were ram-packed. Bikes all taken. The quickest form of transport was on foot.

I felt sorry for a group of Canadian tourists I passed near Hyde Park Corner, and hoped they didn't assume this regularly happens - when it now does.

Naturally, there was no sign of Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, yet again conspicuous by his absence when things go wrong on his watch.

Meanwhile, the M25 protesters continued to laugh in the face of section 137 of the Highways Act 1980, which says it is an offence 'if a person, without lawful authority or excuse, in any way wilfully obstructs the free passage along a highway'.

The think tank, Policy Exchange, says Extinction Rebellion, Insulate Britain, Animal Rebellion and Just Stop Oil are largely made up of the same people, who flirt with suicide as a response to 'climate grief'.

Before scaling motorway gantries or glueing themselves to paintings, these miscreants must pledge to 'take part in action which will lead to my arrest'. And, yet, the Home Secretary is taken to task for labelling these people 'extremists'.

We're not an authoritarian state but a little more authority when it comes to public transport would not go amiss.

I remember being in Tokyo and reading the front page of an English-language newspaper about an inquiry involving one of the bullet trains (pictured above). The issue? The train arrived into Tokyo's Shinkansen terminal two minutes late.

Members of Animal Rebellion - a vegan offshoot of Extinction Rebellion - targeted celebrity steakhouse Nusr-Et in London's Knightsbridge and Mana, a Michelin-starred restaurant in Manchester.

Nusr-Et charges up to £1,450 for a steak covered in gold leaf and is a favourite of stars such as David Beckham and Leonardo DiCaprio.

The worldwide chain is run by Turkish butcher and chef Salt Bae, 39, real name Nusret Gokce, who became an online hit for his apparently unique salt-sprinkling technique. On Saturday night, eight Animal Rebellion protesters sat down at unoccupied tables.

In place of Nusr-Et's usual menus, they held their own demanding subsidies to help farming and fishing move away from meat and urging the promotion of plant-based foods to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

Although police were called, staff acted in advance, appearing to pick up the protesters and carry them out into the street.

One activist said afterwards: 'I'm not sure they're allowed to do that.' Another Orin Cooley-Green, 21, added that the removal was 'tougher than police would do it'.

Student Ben Thomas, 20, said: 'Customers clapped as we were picked up and taken outside. Restaurants like these are symbolic of a broken system.

'Whilst two million people rely on food banks in the UK, influencer chefs are selling gold-plated steaks. Red meats carry the highest environmental impact.'

At the same time at Mana, in Manchester's Ancoats district, 16 smartly dressed Animal Rebellion protesters sat down to stage an identical protest The group said it targeted the restaurant, which is run by chef Simon Martin and offers a set menu costing from £195 per person, because it does not serve vegan food.

It is understood the protesters were forced to leave by police.

The Greater Manchester force said it arrested 14 people on suspicion of aggravated trespass, who have been released on bail pending further inquiries. In London, the Metropolitan Police said activists left before officers arrived and no arrests were made.

Personally I wonder how they will fare exposed to such an abundance of the very stuff they purport to hate, but I am sure they will have teams of first aiders on hand to deal with any chronic cases of hysterical carnophobia which may erupt.

Naturally I respect their right to hold their particular views. In this democracy there is ample opportunity for all minorities to express their opinions in a reasonable, non-violent way. But as we saw with the badger culling issue, demonstrations such as this have an unfortunate tendency to attract support from the Rentarabble ranks who will miss no opportunity for causing a bit of civil disobedience and indulging in a vigorous exchange of opinions (and occasionally blows) with the Bill.

I sincerely hope the leaders of the self-styled Animal Rebellion group have taken and will take all reasonable steps to prevent their assembly descending into such mayhem. If it does, I and many others will be obliged to regard them not as a responsible, well-intentioned campaigning organisation but as yet another ragtag assembly of malcontents ready to resort to violence on the merest pretext.

I have, I think you will agree, reasonable grounds for fearing that this is indeed how things will pan out given that the anti-meat lobby has quite a bit of previous. It's attacked butchers' shops and attempted to intimidate their owners and their customers. It has resorted to criminal damage and to the most unpleasant threats to life and property. It has therefore already established a somewhat unfortunate reputation.

When, may I ask you, are organisations like this going to realise that the more they flout the law and the more they conduct their affairs according to self-created codes which condone and encourage violence and lawbreaking, the less they are going to be treated seriously by the rest of us? I entirely accept that there is a debate to be had over livestock farming's contribution to climate change. I have heard all the arguments about the enormous amounts of energy required to pump nourishment into the front of farmed animals and the emissions given off by what comes out of the back. But to have such arguments shrieked at me by people daubed in fake blood is not going to engage me or persuade me that these people are ready for calm, rational discussions on the subject.

I know that there are many, many like me who feel exactly the same way, equally as we resent any attempt by a hysterical minority to dictate to us what we may or may not include in our diets.

Sadly, then, occupying a meat market - assuming the operation turns out to be of the forecast magnitude - will, far from advancing the debate, be but another gesture, and a fairly pointless one at that.

217,Western Daily Press,Tabloid,2021,You don't mess with McDonald's customers,"DEAR George, The arrogance of some minority, single-interest groups rarely fails to leave me less than astonished, not to say appalled.

Take for instance, the shenanigans at the weekend which saw animal rights activists targeting four McDonald's distribution centres and disrupting deliveries.

What was their avowed intent? Apparently to force the chain to become 100 per cent plant-based by 2025. Absolutely unbelievable.

On whose authority are they making those demands other than that of a tiny minority of the population which has chosen to espouse the vegan creed? (For the moment. While it's fashionable.)

As I have said before, if you don't want to eat meat that's fine. Pass me your share and enjoy the lentils. But don't preach and screech your warped doctrine in my ears because all that is going to do is to erode what small reserves of empathy I have for your cause - though naturally I would defend with vigour your right to adhere to it.

Of course I can see the flawed logic behind choosing McDonald's: it's one of the best-known names in the fast food business; its stores are the most visited and therefore the effects of any disruption are likely to be experienced by the maximum number of people. A lot of bang for the buck in other words.

But McDonald's customers represent a very faithful clientele mainly consisting of confirmed carnivores who are not going to take too kindly to their double quarter pounders with cheese suddenly not being available.

Indeed such might be their annoyance at being deprived that they could well harden their attitudes against the minority of ethical 'warriors' who were responsible for the dearth.

Life should have taught us all that you don't carry people with you by seeking to impose your beliefs in this way, and particularly by insisting on an international corporation which has bestowed all the benefits of the Big Mac on mankind adopting a sourcing and sales policy which is diametrically opposed to its current, long-standing one - and all within the space of three years. Get real.

Anyway the last time I checked

McDonald's credentials seemed pretty sound with the beef being either English or Irish and the eggs free-range.

There is, of course, the matter of whether what it sells is actually wholesome. I certainly wouldn't recommend anyone availing themselves of its gastronomic delights on a daily basis, though in all honesty don't regard someone making an occasional purchase as putting their health at any kind of risk. But nutrition evidently wasn't the issue here - and in any case don't get me started on the nutritional deficiencies which have been highlighted in some vegan products.

You would have thought if these people had any sense they would have chosen a decent target such as Uncle Sam's industrialisation of hormone-rich beef production which leads to so much deforestation in order to plant soy beans for feed.

But then they might find it difficult to criticise the production of the very legume which they consume in various forms as an acceptable alternative to real meat, mightn't they?

",Right,0,507,"You don't mess with McDonald's customersDEAR George, The arrogance of some minority, single-interest groups rarely fails to leave me less than astonished, not to say appalled.

Take for instance, the shenanigans at the weekend which saw animal rights activists targeting four McDonald's distribution centres and disrupting deliveries.

What was their avowed intent? Apparently to force the chain to become 100 per cent plant-based by 2025. Absolutely unbelievable.

On whose authority are they making those demands other than that of a tiny minority of the population which has chosen to espouse the vegan creed? (For the moment. While it's fashionable.)

As I have said before, if you don't want to eat meat that's fine. Pass me your share and enjoy the lentils. But don't preach and screech your warped doctrine in my ears because all that is going to do is to erode what small reserves of empathy I have for your cause - though naturally I would defend with vigour your right to adhere to it.

Of course I can see the flawed logic behind choosing McDonald's: it's one of the best-known names in the fast food business; its stores are the most visited and therefore the effects of any disruption are likely to be experienced by the maximum number of people. A lot of bang for the buck in other words.

The 'Animal Rebellion' protesters called for McDonald's to change to a plant-based menu and be more environmentally friendly.

The protesters attended the fast-food chain where they brought their own lunch and tablecloths, eating salad, cakes and drinking cups of tea.

Police were called by the branch management but officers agreed that no offences had been committed by the peaceful protesters.

The protest follows similar sit-ins held in Weymouth, Yeovil and Dorchester McDonald's branches, as well as McDonald's branches across the country.

Catherine Cannon, a local climate activist at Saturday's sit-in, said: ""The climate and ecological emergency that we are facing is critical, and we need corporations to take the lead and do everything they can to minimise their impact on the climate.

""McDonald's and the wider intensive animal agriculture industry is responsible for huge levels of deforestation and is a major driver of climate change.

221,Western Daily Press,Tabloid,2021,UN warns world is facing 'a climate catastrophe',"THE world is on track for ""climate catastrophe"", the United Nations warned, as it published a report showing that countries' plans to cut emissions still fall far short of curbing dangerous warming.

The UN Environment Programme (UNEP) said, even with new and updated plans and pledges from countries for cutting greenhouse gas emissions in the next decade, the world faces global warming of 2.7C by 2100.

The latest climate plans and pledges to tackle emissions by 2030 only reduce predicted planet-warming pollution by 7.5% by 2030 compared to their previous commitments, it said, but reductions of 55% are needed to meet the goal to limit global temperature rises to 1.5C - beyond which more severe impacts of climate change will be felt, from extreme weather to rising seas.

A total of 49 countries and the European Union have pledged longterm targets to cut emissions to net zero, which could bring temperature rises down to 2.2C, but only if they are fully implemented, with action in the next decade, it said.

The report showed that just a fifth of the recovery investment to help reboot economies after the pandemic had gone to supporting green measures - missing an opportunity to drive action to slash emissions. It also highlighted opportunities to cut emissions quickly, including by tackling the powerful but short-lived greenhouse gas methane, which could be reduced significantly with technology and changes to diet.

Launching the report before world leaders head to Glasgow this week for crucial Cop26 climate talks,

UNEP's executive director Inger Andersen warned: ""The world has to wake up to the imminent peril we face as a species. Climate change is no longer a future problem. It is a now problem.""

UN secretary-general Antonio Guterres said that, less than a week before the talks, ""we are still on track for climate catastrophe"", warning there was a gap in leadership on tackling the crisis.

It is the latest warning over the climate crisis, as emissions of the gases that drive global warming are set to bounce back after the pandemic, and reached record concentrations in the atmosphere in 2020.

Countries at Cop26 are under pressure to deliver on promises made in the global Paris Agreement to hold global temperature rises to ""well below"" 2C and to try to keep warming to 1.5C, to avoid the worst impacts of climate change, but the national plans countries previously put forward for the Paris deal left the world well off-track for the 1.5C and 2C limits, so they have had to submit new or updated plans for action up to 2030, known as nationally determined contributions (NDCs), by Cop26.

The latest annual analysis of the ""emissions gap"", between the action countries are planning and what is needed by 2030, shows that, even with new or updated plans from 120 countries and the EU, as well as new pledges from key polluters such as China, far more needs to be done.

It finds the impact of the new and updated plans will reduce global greenhouse gas emissions by just 2.9 billion tonnes in 2030 compared to the old NDCs.

226,Western Daily Press,Tabloid,2022,Six arrests after protesters target West dairy industry,"SIX people were arrested as animal rights protesters yesterday targeted the West's dairy industry. Protesters from Animal Rebellion blockaded the entrances to the giant Müller dairies at Severnside in Stonehouse in Gloucestershire and at Bridgwater, Somerset.

The campaign group activists began their action at the two sites in the early hours of yesterday.

Protesters trespassed inside the sites, climbed aboard milk tankers, chained themselves to various parts of the sites and climbed on top of large milk silos.

Gloucestershire Constabulary said it arrested five people and seized equipment designed to cause serious disruption during the protests at Severnside.

Avon and Somerset Police made one arrest at Bridgwater.

West farmers will be hoping the protests are swiftly contained and don't impact deliveries from farms around the region to the dairies.

The protests were part of a wider campaign of action that also targeted Arla dairies elsewhere in the country and sit-ins in some supermarket branches. The group said it would continue to take action unless its demands for Britain to transition to a plant-based diet were met.

Protester John Appleton, who previously worked for Arla, said: ""I've seen this industry first hand; I know the struggle that farmers and workers go through every single day. We need a food system that works for them, everyone else, and nonhuman animals.

""Governmental support for this is vital to tackle the climate and ecological emergencies. We know the twin solution: transition to a plantbased food system and a mass rewilding programme.""

Müller however said the protesters were a minority group who did not represent mainstream public opinion. The German-owned firm, whose two West dairies process approximately one billion litres of milk per year, said consumers shouldn't notice supplies being upset.

In a statement it said: ""We are disappointed to be targeted by a small number of activists who don't represent the 96% of adults in Britain who choose milk every week, and we will ensure that supplies are maintained.

""Dairy is affordable and packed with nutrients that benefit our bodies. During a cost of living crisis it is wrong to try to prevent it from reaching families, including vulnerable members of society.""

Meanwhile a spokesperson for Arla said: ""We currently have protesters at our Aylesbury site and are working closely with the local police to resolve the situation.

""The safety and security of our colleagues at the site is our number one priority and production is currently running as normal.""

""The fact is that 96 per cent of people in this country prefer to drink proper milk rather than nutritionally inferior vegan substitutes and intend to carry on doing so.

""Dairy milk is one of the most valuable foodstuffs available on the surface of the planet and has been drunk and enjoyed for millennia, and in this country we are particularly fortunate in having an army of dedicated dairy farmers who supply the market with the best and safest naturally produced milk in the world.

""Attempting to disrupt the supply chain and deprive consumers of a foodstuff they value and consume daily will not achieve anything other than turning large sections of the public against veganism and the extremists who promote it.""

Protesters trespassing at the site of the Muller dairy in Bridgwater in the early hours of Sunday drilled holes in truck tyres to disrupt the company's distribution.

The acts come at the end of a weekend of protests at dairy production areas across England, with eight people arrested after similar protests at the Muller plant in Stonehouse in Gloucestershire.

The protests targeted dairy distribution sites for the second time in 24 hours, after trespassing onto critical dairy distribution facilities and drilling holes in lorry tyres and filling outlet houses with expanding foam.

Speaking yesterday Chief Inspector Dan Forster, of Avon and Somerset Police, said: ""A small number of people accessed the private site at just after 6am yesterday morning. Seven people were arrested yesterday while a further three have been taken into custody this morning.

""They have been arrested on suspicion of offences including aggravated trespass, criminal damage and conspiracy to commit criminal damage. Four of those arrested - all men - have since been bailed with conditions while the others, five men and a woman, remain in custody.

""Five protesters remain on site and they have all climbed on top of objects and locked themselves to them.

""Specialist resources, including the Protest Removal Team, have been brought in to assist with the policing response while officers also remain around the perimeter of the site to prevent any further protesters from gaining access.""

He added: ""Operations are continuing at the site and there hasn't been any impact on the wider public or disruption to surrounding roads.

""We fully respect the fundamental democratic right to protest but where criminal offences are being committed we'll always seek to use the powers available to us to take robust action.""

The Animal Rebellion protests were intended to seriously disable the ability of the facilities to process and distribute milk.

As well as Muller Bridgwater, activists entered sites at Arla Aylesbury, and Muller Droitwich, breaking a High Court injunction by doing so. Protesters want the Government to negotiate with them about transitioning towards a plant-based food system.

Protests have been held across the weekend, with eight having been arrested at Muller's Severnside distribution site near Stonehouse in Gloucestershire.

Early on Sunday police seized equipment at the Stonehouse site designed to cause serious disruption, contributing to the initial arrest of five people. A further three had been arrested by around 9.30pm on Sunday.

230,Western Daily Press,Tabloid,2022,Hunting shops attacked by protesters with paint,"ANIMAL Rebellion (AR) activists vandalised hunting shops with paint as ""hundreds"" of fellow campaigners protested in central London on Saturday to demand a ""plant-based future"".

Campaigners poured red paint inside Farlows, a hunting and fishing shop on Pall Mall, and daubed paint on the windows of William Evans, a shooting supply shop in nearby St James's Street, while others took and emptied milk from supermarkets.

The group, an offshoot of Extinction Rebellion, describes itself as a ""mass movement using non-violent civil disobedience to call for a just, sustainable plant-based food system"".

After putting out a message ""calling all vegans to occupy London"", AR said protesters brought London's West End ""to a standstill"" as people marched from Green Park to Piccadilly Circus.

They are calling on Prime Minister Liz Truss and Environment Secretary Ranil Jayawardena to tackle what they call the ""climate, ecological and cost-of-living crises"".

Fellow environmental campaigners from Just Stop Oil were also seen blocking a road on Park Lane in central London as part of their efforts to stop future gas and oil projects from proceeding.

It comes after two activists from Animal Rebellion targeted Fortnum & Mason and Selfridges and poured milk out in the high-end department stores in central London on Friday.

Dillon Parsons, 21, from Preston, a spokesperson for AR and a film production student at the University for the Creative Arts, said he has been involved with the campaign group for two years.

On Friday afternoon, he said: ""We are currently at Trafalgar Square.

""There are, I'd say, a couple of hundred activists and we are all sat on the ground and demanding that the Government transition to a plant-based future because the UK Government has proved that they don't know how to respond to crises any more.""

""We know that animal farming and fishing is the key cause to the climate crisis, so if we transition away to a plant-based food system we can not only stop 76 billion animals a year from being killed, we can feed the whole population several times over, we can free up 76% of global agricultural land... to give every person and all future generations a chance of having a better future on this planet.""

He said he was not present when the shops were vandalised, but added: ""If the Government responded to us and gave us a chance of a plant-based future we wouldn't have to do actions like this but causing this level of disruption, if this is what is going to get us heard, that's the actions we've got to take.""

233,Western Daily Press,Tabloid,2022,AR is about nonviolent civil disobedience,"HUNDREDS of farm workers and environmental activists have marched through central London in support of sustainable farming.

Members of the Landworkers' Alliance and other farming groups marched from Parliament Square, up Whitehall and past Buckingham Palace on Saturday.

They were led by Gerald Miles, a 74-year-old organic farmer who travelled to London from his South Wales farm in a tractor that was built in 1967.

Mr Miles, who headed up the march from his tractor - which he calls Bess - said: ""We need nature in farming because we're in a climate change crisis.""

He added that it was vital for the Government to keep its Environmental Land Management subsidy schemes (ELMs), designed to replace the EU's common agricultural policy, as they ""promote nature in farming"".

The farmer, from St Davids in Pembrokeshire, spent four days travelling to the capital in his 55-year-old tractor that still has its original clutch.

Mr Miles said: ""It was over 380 miles on A and B roads. It's taken me four days because I could only do 60 to 70 miles a day - she only travels 15 miles an hour.""

The farmer, who is part of the Caerhys Organic Community Agriculture group, said he would be ""cheating"" on his way back to South Wales by putting the tractor, which has no roof, on a trailer.

The list of demands made by those marching included a ""right to food"" to be put into UK law, more Government support schemes for young people and marginalised groups to enter farming, and a bigger budget for agricultural support schemes with ELMs.

Jyoti Fernandes, Landworkers' Alliance policy and campaigns coordinator and one of the lead organisers of the march, said: ""We need the ELM scheme, which is currently under threat by the new Government, to be fully supported - and farmers given the advice and support they need to transition to a climate-friendly farming system.""

Vicki Herd, head of farming at the Sustain Alliance, said: ""We face a huge crisis with climate change and the collapse of nature and yet we continually see Government faffing around - farmers need long-term planning and security.""

The march was organised by the Landworkers' Alliance in collaboration with more than a dozen other food and agriculture organisations including Save British Farming, the Sustain Alliance and the Nature- Friendly Farming Network.

Meanwhile, Animal Rebellion protesters poured milk on to shop floors, displays and products across the country, including Harrods.

The group co-ordinated the action in stores like Waitrose, Whole Foods and Marks and Spencer in London, Manchester, Norwich and Edinburgh just before 12pm on Saturday.

Footage shows several protesters pouring milk, taken from the shelves, on to display cabinets in Harrods' food hall in Knightsbridge.

Another group was filmed emptying milk bottles on to the floor and across a table laden with cheeses in Fortnum and Mason in Piccadilly.

Animal Rebellion said it is calling for a plant-based future and highlighting the need to support farmers in transitioning to a sustainable plant-based food system.

Lou Hadden, a charity worker from Herefordshire who joined the action at Fortnum and Mason, said: ""This is not how I imagined spending my weekend.

""Unfortunately, this disruption is necessary to get those in power to listen to the academics at Oxford, Harvard and the IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change).

""The world's best climate and land scientists are calling for the transition to a plant-based food system.

""We need bold and decisive politics at this time, not the horror show we currently see.""

This is not about climate change, veganism or stopping oil; like many other 'protests' in the past the original good intentions have been hijacked by the far left and anarchist brigade, who see this as an opportunity to engage in their own 'class war' against the wealthy.

235,Western Daily Press,Tabloid,2022,Protests must retain some grasp of legality,"YOU ask whether 'non-violent civil disobedience' can ever be justified. We all have the right to protest, but in a democracy that right must be exercised within the law, as laid down by the representatives of the people.

If the law is wrong, it is for Parliament to change it, not for individuals to arrogate to themselves the right to ignore the rules the rest of us are expected to observe.

Animal Rebellion spokesperson Nathan McGovern seeks to justify the disruptive antics of his organisation by asserting that they are committed to ""non-violent"" action to make their case for a plantbased food system.

The mere fact that activists choose to adopt methods falling short of personal violence is no excuse. Intentional damage to the property of others, deliberately destroying food products (at a time when many families are struggling to feed themselves) and obstructing people going about their lawful business, including preventing them from attending medical and other important appointments, is not only unlawful but also, to my mind, amounts to controlling, coercive behaviour calculated to bully the nation into adopting a lifestyle that the activists have chosen for them. At best, this amounts to breathtaking arrogance; at worst, it seems a step on the road to totalitarianism.

A cynic might be forgiven for thinking that this activism is little more than extremist animal rights ideology dressed up as concern for the planet. Whether or not that is the case, it is difficult to see how damaging and destroying property and obstructing the highway can possibly bring people on board. These antics risk doing huge damage to the case for reducing our impact on our planet.

We can all play our part - perhaps deciding to raise a smaller family; recycling and upcycling; making things last instead of buying the latest; reducing our consumption of utilities; cutting down on travel for leisure purposes; and, yes, even reducing our consumption of certain products.

These antics risk doing huge damage to the case for reducing our impact on our planet.

We can all play our part - perhaps deciding to raise a smaller family; recycling and upcycling; making things last instead of buying the latest; reducing our consumption of utilities; cutting down on travel for leisure purposes; and, yes, even reducing our consumption of certain products.

Many people already choose to do this - and more - quietly, without resort to exhibitionist antics or sanctimonious lecturing. When are we going to learn that people need to be on board to bring about lasting change? Antagonising them is entirely counter-productive."
236,Western Daily Press,Tabloid,2022,"For change to happen, people must rise up","YOU ask whether Animal Rebellion's tactics are misguided. At a point when we have just three years for the Government to take meaningful action to prevent the worst of climate change there seems no other way than to speak loudly about what must be done. Inaction is not an option, but the Government refuses to even talk about changing the unsustainable politics of growth and greed.

Right now, farmers are trapped in systems where they must keep doing what they are doing to qualify for subsidies that are unsustainable and will soon lead to our ruin.

The actual demands of Animal Rebellion couldn't be more reasonable: support farmers to transition to a plant-based food system where they will be able to make a living and we would no longer need to use excessive amounts of land for grazing and growing animal feed.

Then, with the 76% of global farmland freed up, we should rewild to draw down carbon from the atmosphere, restore nature and bring back wildlife.

This isn't about telling people what to do: at no point do Animal Rebellion say that people must be vegan. This is telling the Government that it must put significant changes in place or we have no liveable future.

But the Government are ignoring even their own scientists' advice to phase out animal agriculture and therefore feel Animal Rebellion's tactics are proportional to the urgency of the situation we are all in.

Complacency is just not going to get us out of this and neither is hoping a petition will do the trick. History shows over and over again that in order for change to happen, people must rise up.

In this context, the pouring away of milk in supermarkets demonstrates the absolute waste - of money propping up an unsustainable industry, of land and feed grown to feed cows and, most of all, the waste of cow's lives.

Police said Emma Smart, 45, was arrested on Thursday evening after allegedly causing a disturbance and refusing to comply with officers after they asked her to leave Catch At The Old Fish Market in Weymouth. Animal Rebellion, the protest group behind Smart, said she approached the table where Sir David was dining in an attempt to deliver a letter to him, and shared images of her being dragged away by police at 8.45pm.

Smart, an ecologist from Weymouth, said she wanted a five-minute conversation with Sir David about the need to address climate change.

According to Animal Rebellion, a group calling for a plant-based food system and a mass re-wilding programme, Smart targeted his visit to the Catch restaurant because of its expensive seafood menu. She said in a statement: ""The Catch is a symbol of excess and inequality in today's world, Weymouth has average wages amongst the lowest in the UK and is at huge risk of sea level rises.

239,The Guardian,Broadsheet,2019,Animal Rebellion activists to blockade UK's biggest meat market; London's Smithfield Market part of next wave of Extinction Rebellion climate protests,"Thousands of animal rights and environment activists are planning to blockade Smithfield Market - the largest wholesale meat market in the UK - in the next wave of Extinction Rebellion climate protests.

A new group calling itself Animal Rebellion says it has almost 2,000 volunteers signed up to take part in a two-week blockade of the central London market from 7 October.

Dan Kidby, a spokesman for the group, said it hoped to have 10,000 people taking part in the blockade.

""Animal Rebellion's message to the public, policymakers and the future citizen's assembly is that we need to urgently end the industries of animal farming and fishing, and transition to a plant-based food system in order to avert climate breakdown, mass extinction and ensure justice for farmed animals.""

In April thousands of people joined Extinction Rebellion (XR) protests around the country, including blocking key sites across London for 10 days. They called on the government to tell the truth about the climate crisis and take urgent action to avoid ecological collapse.

XR has said the next wave of protests in October will be focused around Westminster.

Roger Hallam, one of XR's co-founders, said: ""October is the next big rebellion against the British government for the criminal inactivity on the climate emergency and ecological collapse.""

Animal Rebellion was founded in June this year when 18 of the UK's leading animal justice organisations met and agreed to set up the new group. It aims to highlight the ""catastrophic role"" that it says animal agriculture and fishing industries play in the escalating global climate emergency.

Smithfield Market did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Scientists say avoiding meat and dairy products is the single biggest way to reduce the environmental impact on the planet, reducing the land needed for farming by more than 75% globally.

Earlier this month an IPCC report said that intensive farming and razing forests for meat production was having a devastating environmental impact, and that moving to a plant-based diet would help tackle the climate crisis.

Animal Rebellion said activists were being recruited and trained in nonviolent direct action before the next protests. The group is planning to shut down the roads around Trafalgar Square in central London during a broader animal rights' march on Saturday as a dry run.

Alex Lockwood, an academic, author, and spokesman for Animal Rebellion, said the group was aware that many people would find the protests challenging, but that the current food system was ""unsustainable and destroying the planet"".

""We expect people to be angry that we are challenging their comfortable and 'normal' way of life around what they eat. But unfortunately, drastic times call for drastic measures if we are to have any hope of limiting the ravages of climate change. We're sorry in advance for the disruption this causes.""

Although Animal Rebellion is a separate organisation, it has signed up to XR's three demands of the government: to tell the truth about the climate and ecological emergency; to act to halt biodiversity loss and make the UK zero carbon by 2025; and to create a citizens' assembly on climate and ecological justice to decide policy.

This week six activists were arrested after the Brazilian embassy in London was daubed with paint in protest at the ongoing destruction of the Amazon rainforest. There have also been smaller protests in towns and cities across the UK in recent weeks, including in Cambridge, St Ives, Weymouth and Oxford.

240,The Guardian,Broadsheet,2019,Heather Mills launches UK 'vegan northern powerhouse'; 'Plant-based Valley' could help lead consumers' transition from 'cattle culture diet',"Climate activists have welcomed the launch in the Northumberland countryside of a ""vegan Silicon Valley"", which is aimed at helping to fight climate change.

The 55-acre site, the brainchild of the entrepreneur Heather Mills, will offer manufacturing, storage and business space exclusively to vegan entrepreneurs and plant-based businesses.

The valley, 10 miles from Newcastle, has been nicknamed Plant-based Valley. There are hopes for it to be at the centre of a food revolution as the world increasingly turns toward plant-based diets and more people change their eating habits in an attempt to halt the climate emergency.

Mills said it would make the region a ""world centre for the creation of planet-rescuing ideas"" and the ""northern powerhouse for the brightest vegan minds"".

She has previously given her backing to several vegan startups. In 2009 she launched a food range, VBites, which distributes products around the world.

""This is not merely a business and investment enterprise, this is an enterprise on which the future of the planet is going to depend,"" said Mills at the launch of the project at her VBites factory at Seaton Delaval, near Newcastle.

""I have been warning about this for more than 20 years and it is now an accepted scientific fact, endorsed by everyone from the United Nations to David Attenborough to Greta Thunberg's teens-based movement, that the cattle culture diet is having a disastrous effect on the climate and it threatens our very existence.""

Climate activists and the Green party welcomed news of the launch, pointing out the need for humans to cut down on their meat and dairy consumption to halt climate breakdown.

Alex Lockwood, a spokesperson for Animal Rebellion - a partner organisation of Extinction Rebellion - said the launch showed north-east England would take a leading role in the UK's transition to a plant-based food system.

""Newcastle and the north-east has a strong activist community and is rich in vegan cafes and eateries, but for animal justice activists this is fantastic news, because it is creating jobs that people can be proud of and shifting farm and slaughterhouse workers away from animal agriculture and into more secure and sustainable jobs,"" Lockwood said.

""The north-east was the seat of the industrial revolution. And here it is again, leading the way in the UK's plant-based revolution.""

Clare Oxborrow, a campaigner at Friends of the Earth, said: ""As more people choose to eat less meat or cut it out altogether, this move to repurpose an abandoned factory site and support plant-based innovation could be a timely development.""

The Green party's deputy leader, Amelia Womack, said: ""As the IPCC report argued a few months ago, we need to reduce our reliance on meat supply chain to reduce its impact on the climate.

""The UK as a whole should support initiatives and businesses that give us healthy food and at the same time reduce our carbon footprint.""

During the launch, Mills also called on the government not to abandon plans for HS2, which she said provided an ""essential artery"" for businesses in the north.

""HS2 is not only crucial to bolstering the economy of the north and the north-east, it is indispensable to the key role that the [region] can have in providing a manufacturing innovation, which will be a lifeline not only for the UK but for the planet.""",Left-center Bias,1,555,"Heather Mills launches UK 'vegan northern powerhouse'; 'Plant-based Valley' could help lead consumers' transition from 'cattle culture diet'Climate activists have welcomed the launch in the Northumberland countryside of a ""vegan Silicon Valley"", which is aimed at helping to fight climate change.

241,The Guardian,Broadsheet,2019,"Extinction Rebellion arrests near 1,300 after Billingsgate protest; Activists say 28 people were arrested after trying to block access to London fish market
","Police have announced they have made almost 1,300 arrests of Extinction Rebellion protesters since Monday, as activists hope the weekend will swell their numbers for a march through central London.

Animal rights activists affiliated with Extinction Rebellion claimed 28 of their supporters were arrested on Saturday morning while attempting to block access to Billingsgate fish market in east London.

On Saturday, the group's activists are hoping supporters who have been unable to attend demonstrations and actions during the week will join a protest march gathering at Marble Arch from 1.30pm.

Others headed to Westminster magistrates court earlier, where the Paralympian James Brown denied causing a public nuisance by climbing on top of a passenger plane at London City airport on Tuesday.

Hundreds of protesters remained camped in Trafalgar Square, where police were continuing efforts to remove them from their final roadblock in Westminster, and at a new camp site in Vauxhall.

Activists were hopeful that Lambeth council, which has declared a climate emergency, would allow them to use Vauxhall Pleasure Gardens as a ""safe space"" for up to a week and had planned a programme of workshops and events for campers and visitors.

Early on Saturday morning, protesters from Extinction Rebellion's Animal Rebellion chapter sat down to block the entrance to Billingsgate, the UK's largest inland fish market, while one demonstrator locked herself to the entrance, a statement from the group said.

About 200 protesters who had gathered in Canary Wharf began their protest at about 3.30am, according to the group.

Police initially tried to prevent them from reaching the market but relented after negotiations, the group said. Billingsgate management refused a request to enter into a dialogue, according to protesters.

The Metropolitan police said there had been 1,290 arrests in connection with Extinction Rebellion protests as of 9.30am on Saturday, but did not respond to a request for comment on the demonstration.

Kerri Waters, a spokesperson for Animal Rebellion, said: ""To many, eating fish is seen as the healthy choice. But just as land animals suffer, so do fish, who think, make friends and feel pain. But their suffering goes unnoticed.

""At London's Billingsgate market, thousands of fish, stolen daily from their ocean homes, lie dead or dying. Many will have suffocated slowly when pulled aboard fishing vessels, whilst thousands of others remain alive as they're transported by lorry to the market, where they'll be gutted or boiled alive.""

Another spokesperson for the group, Alex Lockwood, said: ""It was our duty to come here and make these demands that we must transition to a sustainable food system and stop exploiting the millions of fish that pass through this market every year.""",Left-center Bias,1,452,"Extinction Rebellion arrests near 1,300 after Billingsgate protest; Activists say 28 people were arrested after trying to block access to London fish market

242,The Guardian,Broadsheet,2019,Extinction Rebellion rush-hour protest sparks clash on London Underground; Commuters clash with demonstrators over morning rush hour disruption,"Extinction Rebellion activists have disrupted London's public transport network during rush hour, in an action that is likely to polarise opinion on the environmental movement's tactics.

There were clashes at Canning Town tube station as commuters dragged a protester from the roof of a Jubilee line train and set upon him. He had to be defended by London Underground staff and other passersby.

At Shadwell, five activists blocked the Docklands Light Railway, with two climbing on top of a train and at least one glued to the door.

Commuters now physically dragging protestors from the roof of the train. 

Phil Kingston, 83, whose hand was glued to the side of a carriage, said he was doing it for the sake of his grandchildren.

""I'm also very concerned about what's happening in the poorer parts of the world who are being hit the hardest by climate breakdown,"" he said. ""I'm a Christian and it really upsets me to see God's creation being wrecked across the world.

""So I'm here on those three counts and I'm longing for the government to take some actions which are in accord with the parliamentary declaration of climate and environmental emergency.""

Police said eight people had been arrested as a result of both incidents.

Ruth Jarman, who sat next to Kingston, said they had targeted the DLR because its destination was London's financial district.

""It's heading for the City, which is the God of our time,"" she said. ""All the scientific reports coming out now about what we should do about the climate breakdown, about the ecological breakdown, we need total transformation of the economy. At the moment we serve economic growth. Humanity, the planet is crucifying itself to economic growth. It cannot go on.""

""I'm a Christian and it really upsets me to see God's creation being wrecked."" 

Extinction Rebellion said in a statement that it was aware the action at Shadwell was divisive, and that many in its movement were not in favour.

It added that those involved included a grandfather, an ex-Buddhist teacher, a vicar and a former GP, who had planned it autonomously.

""We are aware that one of our activists responded in self defence in a moment of panic when confronted by a threatening situation. He acknowledges his accountability for this action and we offer gratitude for members of the public who helped to protect him,"" the group said.

""In light of today's events, Extinction Rebellion will be looking at ways to bring people together rather than create an unnecessary division.""

It later issued an apology in a statement on its Facebook account.

It said: ""Following our previous statement on this morning's London transport actions, we would also like to apologise to all those whose lives we disrupted this morning. We have spent a lot of time thinking about how best to respond.

""Extinction Rebellion remains fully committed to nonviolence. The climate and ecological emergency is the biggest threat facing us all today, and it is unfortunate that something like this has to happen for this to become 'newsworthy'.

""That said, we are all incredibly sad at how events unfolded this morning, and are using this as an opportunity to learn and reflect as an organisation.

Although we are pushing for disruption and civil disobedience, we are still learning how to do this in a way that does not result in violence, and that does not discriminate against hard-working individuals, especially those in communities who stand to be most affected by the climate and ecological crisis and are most vulnerable to systems of power.""

The group launched a wave of civil disobedience on 7 October to highlight the risks posed by the climate crisis and the accelerating loss of plant and animal species. At least 1,711 people have been arrested since the protests started.

Most commuters at Shadwell were not impressed. ""Is an electric train good or not?"" one asked the protesters. ""Is this train good for the environment?""

""The way they're doing it is not right,"" said another, who complained that her daughter was now stuck on a DLR train between stations.

XR said in a statement that activists were willing to go to prison ""in order to save lives in acts of conscience and necessity"".

The group said: ""The actions are intended to bring further economic disruption to the capital as part of the ongoing campaign to convince the government to take meaningful action on the climate and ecological emergency.

""Safety measures are in place to ensure nobody is trapped underground.""

The results of an internal poll of XR members, shared with the Guardian, showed 72% opposed action on London's underground network under any circumstances.

It is understood the results of the survey were shared with the groups planning the transport action before it took place. No information on the size of the sample or the methodology of the poll was given.

One activist who protested at Canning Town but was not arrested said she regretted that commuters had been affected. When XR activists previously took action on the DLR, in April, at Canary Wharf station, it was mainly financial workers who were immediately affected.

XR had said that Thursday was to be a day to ""pause and focus on training, outreach and our plans for attrition actions nationwide in the coming months"".

But instead it proved to be a day in which a number of affiliated groups acted autonomously in staging their own actions around London. In Southwark, two members of the Animal Rebellion faction were arrested outside the offices of the farm standards organisation Red Tractor Assurance.

Connor Thomas, 23, from Newcastle, said Red Tractor was in hock to the farming industry. ""These are farmers regulating farms, they are going to go for whatever the cheapest, most profitable option is - with no care for the animal welfare,"" he said.

Protesters from 13 different groups gathered outside the Bangladesh high commission in a protest over a planned coal-fired power plant they said would despoil and destroy the world's biggest mangrove forest, the Sundarbans.

Dr Akhter Khan, of the Phulbari Solidarity Group UK, said: ""It's a unique ecosystem, home of the Bengal tiger. The Bangladeshi and Indian governments want to set up a coal-based power plant ... that will emit huge amounts of carbon and other pollutants that will cause the destruction of the forest.

Also on Thursday morning, protesters from XR Peace staged actions targeting the London offices of the arms makers Leonardo, Lockheed Martin and BAE Systems. At 11am nine activists from the group glued themselves together outside the supreme court in Westminster.

Sylvia Boyes, 75, a Quaker from Keighly, said: ""We are calling on the supreme court to end all arms sales, especially those to regimes such as Saudi Arabia, where the weapons are being used in clear violation of international humanitarian law in the war on Yemen.""

Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, said: ""I strongly condemn the Extinction Rebellion protesters who have targeted the London Underground and DLR this morning. This illegal action is extremely dangerous, counterproductive and is causing unacceptable disruption to Londoners who use public transport to get to work.

""It is also an unfair burden on our already overstretched police officers. I urge demonstrators to protest peacefully and within the boundaries of the law.""

A rail union meanwhile urged Extinction Rebellion protesters to think again over attempts to disrupt public transport, describing the actions as dangerous and counterproductive.

Manuel Cortes, the general secretary of the TSSA, said: ""Earlier this week I signed a letter condemning the Metropolitan police for banning peaceful climate protest.

""I have not changed my mind on this, but protesters should be mindful that what they have done today has simply inconvenienced ordinary working people trying to get on with their lives and trying to work on the most carbon-emission friendly options available to them to date.""

The ban on XR protests in London is due to remain in place until they finish on Saturday, after judges in the high court put off a hearing on a legal challenge by the group until next week.

Lawyers for XR on Wednesday filed an application for a judicial review of the Metropolitan police's section 14.

Tobias Garnett, a human rights lawyer working with XR's legal strategy team, said: ""While we are disappointed that the court is not able to hear the application sooner - particularly given the immediate risk of people being unlawfully arrested for peaceful, non-violent protest - we nonetheless look forward to putting forward our arguments next week.""",Left-center Bias,1,1397,"Extinction Rebellion rush-hour protest sparks clash on London Underground; Commuters clash with demonstrators over morning rush hour disruptionExtinction Rebellion activists have disrupted London's public transport network during rush hour, in an action that is likely to polarise opinion on the environmental movement's tactics.

There were clashes at Canning Town tube station as commuters dragged a protester from the roof of a Jubilee line train and set upon him. He had to be defended by London Underground staff and other passersby.

At Shadwell, five activists blocked the Docklands Light Railway, with two climbing on top of a train and at least one glued to the door.

Commuters now physically dragging protestors from the roof of the train. 

Phil Kingston, 83, whose hand was glued to the side of a carriage, said he was doing it for the sake of his grandchildren.

""I'm also very concerned about what's happening in the poorer parts of the world who are being hit the hardest by climate breakdown,"" he said. ""I'm a Christian and it really upsets me to see God's creation being wrecked across the world.

""So I'm here on those three counts and I'm longing for the government to take some actions which are in accord with the parliamentary declaration of climate and environmental emergency.""

Police said eight people had been arrested as a result of both incidents.

Ruth Jarman, who sat next to Kingston, said they had targeted the DLR because its destination was London's financial district.

""It's heading for the City, which is the God of our time,"" she said. ""All the scientific reports coming out now about what we should do about the climate breakdown, about the ecological breakdown, we need total transformation of the economy. At the moment we serve economic growth. Humanity, the planet is crucifying itself to economic growth. It cannot go on.""

""I'm a Christian and it really upsets me to see God's creation being wrecked."" 

Extinction Rebellion said in a statement that it was aware the action at Shadwell was divisive, and that many in its movement were not in favour.

It added that those involved included a grandfather, an ex-Buddhist teacher, a vicar and a former GP, who had planned it autonomously.

""We are aware that one of our activists responded in self defence in a moment of panic when confronted by a threatening situation. He acknowledges his accountability for this action and we offer gratitude for members of the public who helped to protect him,"" the group said.

""In light of today's events, Extinction Rebellion will be looking at ways to bring people together rather than create an unnecessary division.""

It later issued an apology in a statement on its Facebook account.

It said: ""Following our previous statement on this morning's London transport actions, we would also like to apologise to all those whose lives we disrupted this morning. We have spent a lot of time thinking about how best to respond.

""Extinction Rebellion remains fully committed to nonviolence. The climate and ecological emergency is the biggest threat facing us all today, and it is unfortunate that something like this has to happen for this to become 'newsworthy'.

""That said, we are all incredibly sad at how events unfolded this morning, and are using this as an opportunity to learn and reflect as an organisation.

Although we are pushing for disruption and civil disobedience, we are still learning how to do this in a way that does not result in violence, and that does not discriminate against hard-working individuals, especially those in communities who stand to be most affected by the climate and ecological crisis and are most vulnerable to systems of power.""

The group launched a wave of civil disobedience on 7 October to highlight the risks posed by the climate crisis and the accelerating loss of plant and animal species. At least 1,711 people have been arrested since the protests started.

Most commuters at Shadwell were not impressed. ""Is an electric train good or not?"" one asked the protesters. ""Is this train good for the environment?""

""The way they're doing it is not right,"" said another, who complained that her daughter was now stuck on a DLR train between stations.

XR said in a statement that activists were willing to go to prison ""in order to save lives in acts of conscience and necessity"".

The group said: ""The actions are intended to bring further economic disruption to the capital as part of the ongoing campaign to convince the government to take meaningful action on the climate and ecological emergency.

""Safety measures are in place to ensure nobody is trapped underground.""

The results of an internal poll of XR members, shared with the Guardian, showed 72% opposed action on London's underground network under any circumstances.

It is understood the results of the survey were shared with the groups planning the transport action before it took place. No information on the size of the sample or the methodology of the poll was given.

The Animal Rebellion group said it staged the protest in central London on Saturday to draw attention to what it believes to be the real cause of the Covid-19 crisis - animal exploitation.

Some activists poured red dye into the fountains, standing up to their knees in the water. Others, dressed as sea creatures, held placards with the words ""global boiling"" and ""don't bait me"" as they staged a socially distanced protest, claiming that the government has ""blood on [its] hands"".

Stephanie Zupan, a representative of Animal Rebellion, said: ""The government must now begin a transition towards a plant-based food system, or risk future zoonotic pandemics of catastrophic proportions.""

Zoonotic diseases are those that are transferred from animals to humans. Covid-19 is widely believed to have originated in an animal, mostly likely a bat, at a seafood market in Wuhan in late 2019. So-called wet markets - where live animals are traded - have been implicated in previous outbreaks of coronaviruses, in particular Sars.

Animal Rebellion said the action was coordinated with protests in 20 cities, including Bristol, Brighton and New York.

244,The Guardian,Broadsheet,2020,"Extinction Rebellion: rights experts say peaceful protest in UK under threat; Liberty condemns 'unworkable restrictions, fines and arrests' used by police to stifle rallies","Civil liberty experts have warned that peaceful protest is under threat in the UK, after the environmental campaigners were targeted with pre-emptive arrest and ""unworkable restrictions"" were placed on this week's Extinction Rebellion (XR) demonstrations.

Thousands of people have taken to the streets this week to highlight the escalating climate emergency and demand urgent action from the government.

More than 200 campaigners have so far been arrested. The civil liberties group Liberty said legitimate protest was being hampered by forceful police tactics.

""Despite the fact the police have a duty to facilitate protest, recent weeks have seen unworkable restrictions, fines and arrests all used to deter us from exercising our rights,"" said Gracie Bradley, the group's interim director. ""These restrictions are heavy-handed and go too far.""

The Metropolitan police has issued restrictions under section 14 of the Public Order Act that state the XR demonstration in Westminster must take place within the off-road area of Parliament Square between 8am and 7pm.

Protesters said it was an attempt to stifle legitimate protest amid government inaction over the climate emergency.

""I think [the police] are a lot more stringent, and much more feisty this time round ... It's very, very different,"" said Alice Huntington, a 48-year-old protester from Bedford.

""I think it's disgraceful, it remains to be seen whether this is legal really, but it's bordering on oppression. We have a legal right to protest, and it feels as though that's not being allowed.""

Roger Lockey, 65, said he felt the police had ramped up their actions for each of the group's rebellions over the past two years. ""The response is much more robust than in October, they are not spending much time allowing us to block roads but we didn't expect it to be the same,"" he said.

Last week five climate activists from the newly formed Beyond Politics group were arrested and charged with conspiracy to cause criminal damage. An XR co-founder, Roger Hallam, was among them and he and another activist, Diana Warner, remain in prison on remand.

Bradley said: ""These tactics are not new but they are damaging as they undermine our right to protest by reframing it as a public nuisance. Peaceful protest is a core pillar of any healthy democracy, and it is vital it is protected whatever the cause.""

The Met declined to comment but directed the Guardian to its website where a statement said the restrictions had been imposed as the protest could ""result in serious disruption to the life of the community"".

This week's demonstrations are the first mass gathering of XR activists since a rebellion planned for earlier this year was cancelled because of the coronavirus pandemic. The group has been warned it could face a £10,000 fine for organising a gathering of more than 30 people under Covid legislation.

In London, XR's latest rebellion has so far focused on Westminster but activists say they intend to target other institutions responsible for the climate crisis in the days ahead.

On Thursday, several protesters in the centre of the capital glued their hands to the pavement in an attempt to block two entrances to parliament, before being removed and arrested by police.

Nearby, a group of eight Animal Rebellion demonstrators stopped traffic outside the Department of Health and Social Care, blocking the road with a slaughterhouse truck to raise awareness of the link between animal farming and the climate crisis, as well as the risk of pandemics.

245,The Guardian,Broadsheet,2021,Britain has promised net zero - but it's on track to achieve absolutely nothing,"Every week governments make headline announcements about saving the planet, and every week their small print unsaves it. The latest puff by the G7 is a classic of this genre. Apparently, all seven governments have committed "" to conserve or protect at least 30% of the world's land and at least 30% of the world's ocean by 2030"". But what does it mean? The UK, which says it secured the new agreement, claims already to have ""conserved or protected"" 26% of its land and 38% of its seas. In reality, it has simply drawn lines on the map, designating our sheepwrecked hills and trawler-trashed seas ""protected"", when they're nothing of the kind. This is the way the world ends. Not with a bang but a press release.

All governments do this, but Boris Johnson's has perfected the art. It operates on the principle of commitment inflation: as the action winds down, the pledges ramp up. Never mind that it won't meet the targets set by the fourth and fifth carbon budgets : it now has a thrilling new target for the sixth one. Never mind that it can't meet its old commitment of an 80% cut in greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. Instead, it has promised us ""net zero"" by the same date. Yes, we need more ambition, yes, the government is following official advice, but ever higher targets appear to be a substitute for action.

Fifteen years ago, I wrote a book called Heat. I tried to work out how far we would have to cut greenhouse gases to fulfil our international obligations fairly, and how we could do it without destroying the prosperity and peace on which success depends. The best estimates at the time suggested that if the UK were justly to discharge its responsibility for preventing climate breakdown, we would need to cut our emissions by 90% by 2030.

Researching the preface for a new edition, I wanted to discover how much progress we've made. An article in the journal Climate Policy uses a similar formula for global fairness. Its conclusion? If the UK were justly to discharge its responsibility for preventing climate breakdown, we would need to cut our emissions by 90% by 2030. And by 2035, it says, our emissions should reach "" real zero "". In other words, in terms of the metric that really counts, we have gone nowhere. The difference is that we now have nine years in which to make the 90% cut, instead of 24.

How could this be true, given that the UK has reduced its greenhouse gas emissions by 49% since 1990? Surely we've been a global leader on climate action?

It's partly because we now know that limiting global heating to 2C commits us to a dangerous world. In theory, governments have accepted a more stringent target of 1.5C. But it's also because, if we ignore the impact of the pandemic, our reduction of greenhouse gases has stalled.

We did the easy things first. Coal-burning power stations were replaced with gas, and some of the gas with renewables. This makes no difference to most people: when we flick the switch, the lights still come on. But almost all the other reductions must involve us directly. They won't happen unless the government mobilises the nation: encouraging us to drive less and use our feet, bicycles and public transport more; taxing frequent flyers ; refitting our homes; reducing the amount of meat we eat; reducing the emissions embedded in the stuff we buy. On these issues, the government's commitment to action amounts to zero. Not net zero. Absolute zero.

Road transport in the UK releases the same amount of greenhouse gases as it did in 1990 : a shocking failure by successive governments. Yet Johnson intends to spend another £27bn on roads. Every major airport in the UK has plans to expand.

Buildings release more greenhouse gases than they did in 2014, and the schemes intended to green them have collapsed. The green homes grant, which the government outsourced to a private company, has been a total fiasco, meeting roughly 8% of its target. At the current rate of installation, the UK's homes will be equipped with low-carbon heating in a mere 700 years.

When I wrote Heat, we were promised that all new homes would soon be green ones. It still hasn't happened, and the date has been pushed back yet again, this time to 2025. Rubbish homes are still being built, which will either require a much more expensive refit or will lock in high emissions for the rest of their lives.

And no one in government wants to touch the biggest issue of all: the greenhouse gases embedded in the stuff we buy, which account for some 46% of our emissions. Government ministers urge China to cut its greenhouse gases, but our economic model depends on us buying junk we don't need with money we don't have. Because the fossil fuels required to produce most of it are burned overseas and don't appear in our national accounts, the government can wash its hands of the problem.

But something has changed for the better: us. In 2006, climate campaigners beat their heads against public indifference.

246,The Guardian,Broadsheet,2021,Environmental campaigners stage 'festival-type' protests at G7,"Thousands of protesters, young and old, took to the sea and the beaches and streets of Cornwall to try to make their voices heard by the G7 leaders.

Arguably, the most picturesque demonstration took place off Gyllyngvase Beach in Falmouth where more than 1,000 surfers, kayakers and swimmers staged a ""paddle out"" organised by Surfers Against Sewage (SAS) to call for more protection for the world's seas and oceans.

Surfers from all over the UK unfurled banners demanding: ""Save our seas"" while others chanted: ""Climate action, now!"" and: ""Do not let or planet die!"" A giant, inflatable shark warned against the issue of sea life consuming discarded plastic.

Rhi Westcott, who travelled from Cheltenham, Gloucestershire to join the paddle out, said: ""Today is about sending a message to governments that the world demands action, that helping to better protect our oceans and the environment is paramount.""

Joe Turnbull from Falmouth said: ""Living in Cornwall, I always feel acutely aware of the environment all around us. You far too often see plastic on the beaches or in the sea when out swimming and paddle boarding yet governments around the world always seem so slow to act or drive change.

""Action is needed now to prevent the climate catastrophe we are hurtling towards, and with the G7 in town this was the perfect time to make our voices heard.""

Hugo Tagholm, the chief executive of SAS, said: ""We've got world leaders in Carbis Bay discussing how we're going to emerge from the pandemic greener and more sustainable and the ocean needs to be central to that. We have to put the ocean at the heart of climate action.

""We've seen in the pandemic that they can mobilise huge amounts of money and collaborate to create vaccines in just a year. But they need to act with the same urgency for the nature, biodiversity and ecological crisis. Now's the time for radical action - business as usual is killing planet ocean.""

Arguably, the most picturesque demonstration took place off Gyllyngvase Beach in Falmouth where more than 1,000 surfers, kayakers and swimmers staged a ""paddle out"" organised by Surfers Against Sewage (SAS) to call for more protection for the world's seas and oceans.

Surfers from all over the UK unfurled banners demanding: ""Save our seas"" while others chanted: ""Climate action, now!"" and: ""Do not let or planet die!"" A giant, inflatable shark warned against the issue of sea life consuming discarded plastic.

Rhi Westcott, who travelled from Cheltenham, Gloucestershire to join the paddle out, said: ""Today is about sending a message to governments that the world demands action, that helping to better protect our oceans and the environment is paramount.""

Joe Turnbull from Falmouth said: ""Living in Cornwall, I always feel acutely aware of the environment all around us. You far too often see plastic on the beaches or in the sea when out swimming and paddle boarding yet governments around the world always seem so slow to act or drive change.

""Action is needed now to prevent the climate catastrophe we are hurtling towards, and with the G7 in town this was the perfect time to make our voices heard.""

Hugo Tagholm, the chief executive of SAS, said: ""We've got world leaders in Carbis Bay discussing how we're going to emerge from the pandemic greener and more sustainable and the ocean needs to be central to that. We have to put the ocean at the heart of climate action.

","Four activists have been arrested at a protest that lasted almost three days at a McDonald's burger factory in Scunthorpe.

About 50 activists from Animal Rebellion claimed they had prevented millions of burgers from leaving the factory, and urged the fast food chain to move to a meat- and dairy-free menu by 2025 to help protect the future of the planet.

On Thursday, dozens began blockading the food distribution centre on Luneburg Way in the Lincolnshire town. They erected tall bamboo structures and shackled themselves to one another to prevent vehicles entering or leaving the plant, but were gradually removed by police using a crane, which officers abseiled down from.

""We're here to disrupt their supply chain and send a clear message that the company need to take seriously their destructive impact on our climate and environment, as well as the deaths of billions of animals, and move to a plant-based food system,"" said spokesperson Harley McDonald-Eckersall.

248,The Guardian,Broadsheet,2021,Extinction Rebellion protesters block Oxford Circus in London,"Extinction Rebellion protesters have blocked Oxford Circus in London, the site of one of the group's most famous occupations, as women took the lead on the third day of its latest campaign of disobedience.

Just before 2pm, protesters swarmed into the middle of the intersection between Regent Street and Oxford Street, London's busiest shopping district, and erected a pink structure and sound system.

Police charged into the road to seize the structure and were then surrounded by female protesters. Women who spoke to the Guardian claimed officers trampled them as they rushed to secure their cordon.

The Metropolitan police said as of 6pm on Wednesday, a further six had been arrested for a ""variety of offences"", bringing the number of arrests made over the course of the protests to 196.

Helen, 58, from Devon, who declined to give her surname, said: ""They climbed in the middle. We had no intention to surround the police. Our intention was to protect what's inside our ring, our circle. We all just had to scream because we were glued together.""

Earlier an inclusive Fint (female, intersex, non-binary and trans) protest mobilisation rallied at the statue of Eros in Piccadilly Circus and marched through Soho.

Bhavini Patel, an XR activist who spoke at the rally, said: ""Today's protest is calling upon feminine energy and recognising that women's voices are still not part of the solution and the centring of what this emergency requires.

""We know that women, given the chance, know how to find the words and the power and the courage that's needed to make the change that's needed for humanity.""

Marvina Newton, who also addressed protesters, said: ""The idea is to talk about what we need to do as women to change the scope of our future. As women we need to stand united in everything we do.""

Larni Aura, 15, from Fulham, had joined the protest with her mother, Ima Aura, 33. ""This is for my future and my whole generation's future and the next generation's future, so it's crucial at this point for as many people as possible to get together and be here,"" Larni said.

Her mother added: ""I feel it's my duty to educate her and open her eyes to the climate crisis, and I think as citizens we have the right to protest.""

XR said its activists had intended to put up a 2.5-metre-tall structure at Oxford Circus designed to look like a giant table. In the event it looked half-finished after the speedy intervention by police.

Explaining the rationale behind a specifically female-led action, the group pointed to research showing women are especially vulnerable to the effects of a worsening climate, but are also in many cases leading the fight against the climate crisis.

The Metropolitan police tweeted: ""Officers intervened when protesters were building a structure at Oxford Circus. Some individuals have glued themselves to the structure, specialist officers are working to support their removal. There will be some disruption to traffic in the area as roads are currently blocked, which we are working to reduce.""

Some women were hurt as police charged in. Zoe Cohen, 50, from Warrington, had her glued hand ripped from the woman next to her. It was bandaged when she spoke to the Guardian.

She said: ""I'm a white middle-aged woman, I've not experienced police violence before ... now I have direct experience of police violence. The public need to know that women and mothers trying to protect their children are being violently attacked by our state police. We pay their wages and they basically attacked us for trying to protect all life on earth.""

Just before 4pm, police issued a section 14 notice, imposing restrictions on the demonstration. ""The protest and assembly at Oxford Circus must cease immediately,"" the force wrote on Twitter, and a van was deployed to the protest to play the terms of the order through a loudspeaker.

Officers first targeted drummers from Extinction Rebellion's samba, ordering them to leave the area. Once the music was silenced, police brought in specialist officers to cut loose those who had been locked in place.

249,The Guardian,Broadsheet,2021,Animal Rebellion paints Buckingham Palace fountain red,"Animal rights activists linked to Extinction Rebellion have painted the fountain outside Buckingham Palace red, accusing the Queen of having ""blood on her hands"".

Animal Rebellion activists stained the fountain and its waters on Thursday, protesting against the use of crown lands for hunting and animal agriculture, as well as the Queen's attempts to have her land exempted from an initiative to cut carbon emissions.

""[The protest was] to symbolise the blood on the Queen's hands and the royal family's crimes against animals and our planet,"" said Dora Hargitai, the co-founder of Animal Rebellion, accusing them of ""decimating the environment"".

""We believe crown land should be used to grow healthy and nutritious food for all of us,"" she said. ""We cannot resolve the climate crisis without resolving the animal crisis and food crisis at the same time, which are all interlinked.""

Meanwhile, XR protesters staged a sit-in outside the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy on Thursday, demanding an end to new investment in fossil fuels.

The ""stop the harm"" march brought XR together with partner groups including campaigners against road building and the HS2 rail project, and for the protection of animals.

""The key message of today is stopping the harm. When you're in an existential crisis, when the life support systems of the earth are literally breaking down ... the first thing you do is to stop the harm,"" said Gail Bradbrook, an XR co-founder. ""Unfortunately our government, and this department in particular, is actively involved in harming our planet.""

She said the government's environmental pledges were ""hot air"", carrying a two-page list which, she said, showed how for each pledge made by the government it had enacted policies that undermined them, for example through road investments and HS2.

Bradbrook also highlighted the government's investments into fossil fuels, including the Cambo oilfields in Scotland and, further abroad, Mozambique's gas fields.

The department has been targeted by previous XR protests - in 2018, activists glued their hands to the department's windows and in 2019 doctors protested outside to focus on how the climate crisis was affecting health.

Caspar Hughes from XR Roads Rebellion, the transport-focused movement, called for an end to investment in road building, which he said led to more investment into and use of fossil fuels.

Hughes said that, after four days of the current disobedience campaign, he was encouraged by the reaction and that the public found it easier than in the past to understand the ""immediate demand"" to stop fossil fuel investment.

""Stop investing in fossil fuels, it's simple. It's really striking home. The public is starting to get it and the media is starting to get it,"" he said. ""We're spending £27bn on building new roads, which is complete, total suicide. If you build new roads they get filled up with new cars; each car is 12 tonnes of embedded emissions.

""It's that immediate demand that's really important. It's something we have to do now. It's not a case of doing anything, it's a case of stopping doing something that's going to kill us. We can stop searching for new fossil fuels.""

When the march arrived at the department, the author Rupert Read opened the speeches by calling for a minute of silence for everyone who had died from the climate emergency ""in the unprecedented American heat dome, in the ring of fire around the Mediterranean, in the appalling fires spreading over Siberia, in the floods in Japan, Germany, Belgium, in many frontline climate states"".

Hannah Crowther, 21, a student, said she joined the protest after deferring her final year of university to focus on environmental campaigning.

""This is literally the most important crisis we've ever faced, so I can't wait any longer. I'm in a lucky position where I feel like I can give that time. I'm pretty scared - I think I've been thinking about climate change since I was 11,"" she said.

They are demanding that Arla, a Denmark-based multinational food conglomerate with an annual turnover of about 10bn, switches entirely to plant-based foods by 2025.

James Ozden, one of the group, said they had began their direct action at about 5am, with activists walking into the Aylesbury site and assembling their lock-on structures. By 9am about 10 police officers had arrived, he said. Workers and drivers expecting to work from the site were standing around outside.

Ozden pointed to the recent IPCC report on the need for drastic action on greenhouse gas emissions ""including methane, which is in large part a byproduct of animal farming"".

He said: ""Companies like Arla claim to be leading the way in tackling the climate crisis, yet until these big multinationals start to talk seriously about the inevitable need to transition our food system to one that is plant-based, their words are empty.""

Arla said it was a farmers' cooperative committed to producing dairy products in the most sustainable way possible, and that it intends to reach net zero emissions by 2050.

""We are working with the police to limit the impact of this demonstration to both our customers and those living locally to the site,"" a spokesperson said. ""We have managed to complete our morning shift changeover and all colleagues are safe; however, access to the site for our larger vehicles is being blocked.""

Later in the day, police in London drew batons against Extinction Rebellion protesters in an open top bus blocking the road at the south end of London Bridge.

The melee came as a protest march from City Hall reached London Bridge station, meeting the bus that had blocked the junction. In a step up in tactics from the Metropolitan police, officers climbed up to board the bus from the top, while their colleagues swung batons at protesters inside.

Previously police had sought to be more careful in making arrests when XR protesters have begun occupations, but in the past week officers have increasingly sought to nip such actions in the bud before they can take hold.

Elsewhere, a dozen activists affiliated with XR Youth Solidarity and WTF WWF occupied the headquarters of WWF in Woking at 9.30am. They said they were occupying the NGO's offices in solidarity with indigenous groups in Tanzania, Cameroon and Kenya who they say are being evicted and persecuted by WWF's conservation activities.

A spokesperson for the group said three activists initially gained access to the offices by posing as members of an environmental group.

Activists were asked to gather at City Hall, near Tower Bridge at midday for what was advertised as a ""new occupation"". At the same time, a so-called ""pram rebellion action"" was expected to begin in Parliament Square. Just after 1pm, the XR Families group was expected to meet at St Paul's cathedral for a ""play-in and feed-in""."
251,The Guardian,Broadsheet,2021,Police wield batons during XR's London Bridge bus blockade,"Police in London wielded batons and threw punches against Extinction Rebellion protesters as they battled to gain control of an open-top bus blocking London Bridge on Tuesday, in a step-change in their use of force against the group.

On the ninth day of XR's latest protest campaign, the Guardian witnessed officers from the Metropolitan police climb the sides of the bus parked across the junction at the south of the bridge, striking and wrestling with protesters.

At one point in the melee, an officer appeared to hit a colleague who was climbing on the bus. Inside, officers appeared to put one protester in a headlock and beat them.

Paul Stephens, a retired detective sergeant with the Met, who is now an Extinction Rebellion police liaison, described the Met's actions as ""an appalling example of policing"". ""Clearly they've got orders to use force on protesters that are trying to protest peacefully in the street,"" he said.

One window of the bus was smashed by the time police had managed to climb aboard and gain control. Gail Bradbrook, the XR co-founder, who was marching with the protest, said: ""What we witnessed from the Met police there was breaking glass when people were nearby, and use of truncheons and use of force. I saw someone in a headlock, people being thrown around. It was an act of aggression in the face of peaceful civil disobedience.

""It begs the question of quite what instructions these officers were given this morning.""

The drawing of truncheons against XR protesters marked an apparent change in the Met's approach to the group. During previous XR campaigns, which have often involved roadblocks and peaceful civil disobedience, officers have taken an incremental approach to clearing blockades, carefully removing protesters from barricades and carrying them away.

""It's the police committing mindless violence when they're supposed to be protecting us,"" one XR supporter at the scene, 66-year-old Carol Jones from Southport, said.

Protesters remained around the bus for several hours after the fracas, while the officers involved appeared to be relieved and replaced. At 4pm, the Met imposed a section 14 order, requiring the protest to end immediately. Protesters moved on, following a samba band down Borough High Street and west along Southwark Street. A number of activists remained inside the bus and locked beneath.

A Met statement said given the demonstration was an ""attempt to cause major disruption to one of London's busiest bridges"" the use of force ""was reasonable and proportionate"". They added that 43 arrests were made.

The fracas came after XR protesters gathered by City Hall before beginning a march through London Bridge. This week, the protest group said it wanted to begin targeting the nearby City of London financial district to drive home their key demand of an immediate end to investment in new fossil fuel projects.

Siân Berry, the Green party London assembly member and candidate for London mayor, who briefly joined the march, said: ""When it comes to driving the extinction that everyone's worried about, it's the continued investment in fossil fuels [that's the problem], and the City needs to mend its ways as quickly as possible.""

Also on Tuesday, a so-called ""pram rebellion action"" began in Parliament Square, while an XR Families group was expected to meet at St Paul's Cathedral for a ""play-in and feed-in"". In the afternoon, activists gathered in front of the Bank of England to discuss a recent Unicef report on the impact of the climate crisis on children.

Earlier, about 50 vegan environmental activists from the Animal Rebellion group blockaded the Arla dairy distribution centre in Buckinghamshire, calling for a transition to a plant-based food system.

A dozen other activists from XR Youth Solidarity occupied the headquarters of WWF in Woking in a protest against conservation activities they said were leading to persecution and eviction of indigenous peoples in Tanzania, Cameroon and Kenya.

A spokesperson for the XR Youth Solidarity occupation said they had been threatened with arrest, but were trying to negotiate with WWF. ""Hours ago [they] said they will get in touch with WWF Tanzania and WWF Kenya to see what they could do about the demands but we haven't heard back from them about it in a while,"" he said.

252,The Guardian,Broadsheet,2021,The cow in the room: why is no one talking about farming at Cop26?,"""The cow in the room is being ignored at this Cop,"" says Carl Le Blanc of Climate Healers. ""Animal agriculture has been taken off the agenda and put on the menu.""

Le Blanc was one of a number of campaigners who joined climate marches on Saturday in Glasgow to demand action for a new sustainable food system. They fought strong gales to make their point with four giant inflatable animals tethered on ropes above their heads or strapped to the ground. Each symbolised a different problem of the livestock industry: a 40ft cow for methane, a chicken for Covid and health , a fish for microplastics, and a pig for obesity.

Many industry representatives and campaigners feel not enough attention has been paid to food and farming at Cop26 , despite it being one of the keys to cutting emissions over the next few decades. Food served at the canteen has been criticised - nearly 60% of dishes contain meat or dairy, which campaign group Animal Rebellion described as the equivalent of ""serving cigarettes at a lung cancer conference"".

During the two weeks of the conference, themes such as finance, energy and transport have been allocated their own days, but there has been no dedicated day for agriculture or food systems. Farming was included in Nature day on Saturday, where there was a lot of talk about protecting forests but less about cutting meat consumption, food waste and firm pledges to change farming subsidy systems.

Farming is a complex issue on the journey to net zero, as it is both a source and sink for emissions. About 20% of global emissions come from agriculture and land use, and this rises to more than 25% for the food system as a whole, which includes processing, packaging and transport. Yet huge amounts of carbon can be sequestered by modifying farmland, with the creation of more forests, healthier peatlands and wetlands. Although some argue that we should stop consuming animal livestock altogether, others believe that low densities of grazing animals such as cattle are an important part of creating farmland habitats that produce food and also provide a home for wildlife.

In terms of individual action, moving to a more plant-based diet is one of the single most effective ways to reduce emissions, but the UK government appears to be unwilling to put the science on this issue into policy. It quickly deleted research alongside its net zero strategy that encouraged levies on high-carbon foods, such as meat.

None of the presidents of the UK's four farming unions present at Cop26 believe they should reduce livestock numbers in their respective countries, or that people need to reduce their meat consumption. They told the Guardian methane emissions could be dealt with through new technologies rather than reducing the number of cows on farms. Thomas Vilsack, the US secretary of agriculture says he believes Americans can carry on eating the same amount of meat while keeping the world within safe limits on global heating.

In a small side room at the Cop26 conference, pro-vegan groups said there was more discussion of meat than at the Cop two years ago, but still policy lagged far behind science. ""Animal meat is obsolete, it doesn't make any sense. It's from the last century,"" says Bernat Añaños, co-founder of plant-based meat company Heura Foods.

But others warn it is dangerous to reproduce historical tendencies to tell farmers what their goals should be. ""There cannot be a one size fits all,"" says Ishmael Sunga, CEO of the Southern African Confederation of Agricultural Unions (SACAU). ""I respect that space, but they cannot impose their views on others.""

Small family farms produce a third of the world's food, and hundreds of millions of people depend on livestock farming for their livelihoods. Although farming for animal proteins is a key driver of biodiversity loss, Sunga says it is important to make sure any changes are fair for producers on the front line. ""It needs to be a just transition. We know most of the farmers in developing countries are near-destitute. It's also an irony that food is one of the biggest industries in the world, but it delivers so badly for farmers. They go hungry, they absorb the climate front-risk, while the rest of us carry on walking around smiling.""

The only significant agricultural announcement made on farming at the leaders' summit was the AIM4C declaration unveiled by the US president, Joe Biden, in partnership with the UAE. It promised an extra $4bn for agricultural innovation aimed at reducing emissions. But this has been criticised by many activists who say it is an attempt to reframe destructive intensive farming as part of the climate solution, instead of the problem.

""The US and the UAE are presenting a vision for the future of farming that is a future without farmers. Such a form of agriculture is a dangerous fantasy,"" says Tom Wakeford, an ecologist and action researcher at ETC Group.

There are two main camps when it comes to agriculture's relationship with wildlife. Some believe in land sparing, which is essentially farming intensively with separate areas for wildlife, while others believe in land sharing, which refers to agroecological approaches where farming and wildlife co-exist.

Jyoti Fernandes, a Dorset farmer and policy and campaigns coordinator at the Landworkers' Alliance, is a proponent of the latter. She believes livestock is an important part of traditional land management. For her, the key is to stop intensive meat farming and focus on producing high-quality meat within smaller, mixed farms that provide high employment for local people.

""It's outrageous that so little time at Cop26 has been devoted to agroecological farmers,"" she says. ""The programme is very weak. If they are promoting nature we must talk about farming. Agroecological farming can nurture biodiversity, sequester carbon and regenerate the planet by looking after our soil, creating habitat and planting trees.""

We can't do anything without farmers, they are the eco-workforce of the future

Minette Batters, president, National Farmers Union, England

Subsidies are at the heart of how agricultural landscapes have been shaped. A recent UN report concluded that almost 90% of the $540bn of global agricultural subsidies given to farmers destroy nature and fuel the climate crisis. Subsidies have generally encouraged farmers to produce as much food as possible, but this has been at the expense of wildlife.

With habitat destruction due to the expansion of farmland identified as one of the main drivers of biodiversity decline, many are arguing for farming subsidies to be radically overhauled. The UN report found redirecting subsidies to beneficial farming practices could be a ""game changer"", yet there was little mention of them in the leaders' speeches at Cop26.

The most significant announcement came on Nature day, when governments endorsed the Policy Action Agenda , signalling their intent to shift agricultural subsidies to better support climate and nature-friendly farming. Although it only involved 16 countries, it included large emitters, such as Switzerland, Nigeria, Spain and UAE; in total these countries represent 10% of world's greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture. The UK also launched a £65m Just Rural Transition programme to help developing countries move towards more sustainable agricultural systems.

The UK farming policy Environmental Land Managements (ELMs), announced earlier this year, will reward farmers for delivering public goods, such as tree-planting, water retention and biodiversity benefits on their farms. Farmers grazing livestock less intensively, with more space for nature on their farms, will also be rewarded.

England's National Farmers Union president, Minette Batters, says changing the subsidy system and harnessing private funds is an opportunity to implement nature-based solutions such as planting trees, using less chemical fertilisers, creating more hedges and enriching soils on farmland.

""We've got the opportunity to create a new relationship with the land, and new economic value for the land. We all talk about it, but we're absolutely appalling at delivering the finance back into where it needs to go. Those trillions just circulate in the ether. We've got to drive that financial resource back into the soil.

""We can't do anything without farmers, they are the eco-workforce of the future,"" she says.

While many industries like coal and gas might have felt positive about not being included in the Cop26 programme, many farmers feel they can make a real difference.

""What is baffling for us, is why farming is not on the table with negotiators,"" says Sunga. ""By focusing on other areas and not focusing on food and agriculture you are running away from the problem, and that's where solutions with the greatest impact are going to be.""",Left-center Bias,1,1417,"The cow in the room: why is no one talking about farming at Cop26?""The cow in the room is being ignored at this Cop,"" says Carl Le Blanc of Climate Healers.

253,The Guardian,Broadsheet,2022,Animal Rebellion activists arrested after disrupting platinum jubilee event on Mall,"Animal rights activists linked to Extinction Rebellion have been arrested after disrupting the start of platinum jubilee celebrations by storming the Mall during the trooping the colour parade.

Scotland Yard said officers made several arrests after the protesters jumped over barriers lining the Mall and confronted marching Grenadier Guards with leaflets demanding an end to hunting on royal land.

Animal Rebellion said 25 of its supporters disrupted the parade due to ""the crown's inaction on the climate emergency and their continued support for meat, fishing, and dairy"".

In a tweet showing the protest, Animal Rebellion said: ""Animal Rebels disrupt the Queen's Platinum Jubilee celebrations demanding that Royal Land is Reclaimed. This summer, we're taking bigger action against the Dairy industry than ever before, and we need you!""

BREAKING: Animal Rebels disrupt the Queen's Platinum Jubilee celebrations demanding that Royal Land is Reclaimed. This summer, we're taking bigger action against the Dairy industry than ever before, and we need you! 

A group of protesters were dragged by police out of the path of a military band as they marched along at about 10.10am.

Video of the incident showed at least eight protesters leaping the barriers to the Mall. At least two protesters sat on the tarmac as a military band stepped around them.

Last year, Animal Rebellion daubed red paint on the fountain outside Buckingham Palace, accusing the Queen of having ""blood on her hands"". The group campaigns against the use of crown lands for hunting and animal agriculture, as well as the Queen's attempts to have her land exempted from an initiative to cut carbon emissions.

255,The Guardian,Broadsheet,2022,"Animal Rebellion activists vow to disrupt UK milk supplies

","Vegan activists have vowed to cause massive disruption to the UK’s milk supplies this month, as they demand the government supports a transition to a “plant-based food system” and rewild land used for animal pasture.

Animal Rebellion, an offshoot of Extinction Rebellion that focuses on the environmental harms of animal agriculture, claims it has hundreds of supporters willing to be arrested and go to prison for taking direct action.

The group also said it would take action at supermarkets in five UK cities on Saturday by blocking shoppers from reaching milk and dairy aisles.

In a statement, the group said “millions of consumers will be unable to buy dairy milk” once it begins taking action in the first two weeks of September.

“We have spent months trying all the proper channels to engage with the government on the scientific consensus to transition to a plant-based future, but they have chosen to ignore us,” Animal Rebellion’s statement said. “We have been left with no choice but to step into civil resistance to pressure government action to preserve our futures.

“We are announcing our intentions in advance so the British public [can] prepare for a disruption to the milk supply this September.

We cannot sit by and let this happen.”

Animal Rebellion is known for its blockade-style tactics, having previously prevented access to McDonald’s distribution centres , factories and restaurants, the UK’s biggest dairy , and London’s last remaining abattoir.

So far this year, activists from the group have disrupted the trooping the colour ceremony at the Queen’s platinum jubilee celebrations, invaded the track at the Epsom derby horse race, and emptied milk bottles on to the floor in the food hall at Harrods department store in London.

The group says it has raised more than £40,000 to support its campaign against milk supplies, but expects to receive more donations once the actions begin.

Many of Animal Rebellion’s supporters and organisers have had key roles in other environmental campaigns, including Extinction Rebellion and Just Stop Oil.

In a press conference on Wednesday, the group said it was opposed to all animal agriculture but was targeting milk because it was “the weak link in the animal farming industry”. One in three households were already switching to non-dairy milks, while dairy farmers were among the most hard-pressed of all agricultural businesses, activists said. But, most importantly, milk had the shortest shelf-life of all potential targets.

Arla, the UK’s largest dairy processor, declined to comment on the threatened protests.

Dr Judith Bryans, the chief executive of Dairy UK, said: “It’s difficult to comment upfront before any events take place, but we are very disappointed at Animal Rebellion’s planned action, which could cause totally unnecessary disruption for businesses and consumers and is unhelpful during a cost of living crisis. We’d urge them to rethink their actions.”",Left-center Bias,1,498,"Animal Rebellion activists vow to disrupt UK milk supplies

Vegan activists have vowed to cause massive disruption to the UK’s milk supplies this month, as they demand the government supports a transition to a “plant-based food system” and rewild land used for animal pasture.

Animal Rebellion, an offshoot of Extinction Rebellion that focuses on the environmental harms of animal agriculture, claims it has hundreds of supporters willing to be arrested and go to prison for taking direct action.

The group also said it would take action at supermarkets in five UK cities on Saturday by blocking shoppers from reaching milk and dairy aisles.

In a statement, the group said “millions of consumers will be unable to buy dairy milk” once it begins taking action in the first two weeks of September.

“We have spent months trying all the proper channels to engage with the government on the scientific consensus to transition to a plant-based future, but they have chosen to ignore us,” Animal Rebellion’s statement said. “We have been left with no choice but to step into civil resistance to pressure government action to preserve our futures.

“We are announcing our intentions in advance so the British public [can] prepare for a disruption to the milk supply this September. We apologise for any stress this may cause during a cost of living crisis, but the government are sleepwalking every single one of us into poverty, misery, and climate and ecological collapse.

256,The Guardian,Broadsheet,2022,Animal Rebellion activists stop milk supply in parts of England,"More than 100 supporters of Animal Rebellion stopped the supply of fresh milk across large areas of England in the early hours of Sunday, including Arla Aylesbury, which processes 10% of the UK supply.

It came after the activist group, who campaign for a sustainable plant-based food system, received no response to a letter to Downing Street in August, in which they warned of disruptive action in September unless progress towards their demands was made.

Members of Animal Rebellion stopped and climbed on company trucks outside four facilities supplying milk to the Midlands and south of England. Others entered company premises, climbing on to milk silos and the sites’ loading bays.

The four distribution centres, operated by Müller and Arla, together process an estimated 2bn litres of fresh milk annually.

The group has said its supporters will continue to take direct action until the British government negotiates on its two demands.

It is calling for the government to support farmers and fishing communities to move away from animal farming and fishing as part of an immediate transition to a plant-based food system.

It also wants the government to commit to rewild the freed-up land and ocean as part of a broader programme of wildlife restoration and carbon drawdown.

John Appleton, who worked at Arla for six years and is taking part in the protest, said: “I’ve seen this industry first-hand, I know the struggle that farmers and workers go through every single day. We need a food system that works for them, everyone else, and nonhuman animals.

“Governmental support for this is vital to tackle the climate and ecological emergencies. We know the twin solution: transition to a plant-based food system and a mass rewilding programme.”

Steve Bone, a photographer from Thorpe-le-Soken in Essex who also joined the action, said: “A plant-based future would restore the British countryside and all the wonderful nature lost to animal farming … A plant-based future would enable massive carbon drawdown and mitigate the worst impacts of the climate crisis.”

A spokesperson for Müller UK and Ireland confirmed the sites targeted were at Droitwich, Severnside and Bridgwater.

He said: “We are disappointed to be targeted by a small number of activists who don’t represent the 96% of adults in Britain who choose milk every week, and we will ensure that supplies are maintained.

“Dairy is affordable and packed with nutrients that benefit our bodies. During a cost of living crisis it is wrong to try to prevent it from reaching families, including vulnerable members of society.”

An Arla spokesperson said: “We currently have protesters at our Aylesbury site and are working closely with local police to resolve the situation. The safety and security of our colleagues at the site is our number one priority and production is currently running as normal.”

The protest comes a day after Animal Rebellion campaigners gathered at a Whole Foods store in London, and Marks & Spencer supermarkets in Southampton, Manchester and Birmingham, holding signs that read “Plant-based future” and “Rewild our land” as they tried to stop shoppers from buying milk.

On Saturday, Extinction Rebellion had been due to occupy Hyde Park for a three-day “festival of resistance”. But on Thursday night the climate activist group circulated a statement saying the protest was cancelled.

“Due to [the] news about the passing of Queen Elizabeth, the decision has been made to postpone this weekend’s planned Festival of Resistance in London until further notice,” the group said in a statement.

Ongoing protests by Animal Rebellion targeting dairy distribution centres in the Midlands and the south of England have also been paused, the Guardian was told.

“Ending new fossil fuel production would be the only fitting memorial to Queen Elizabeth II,” Just Stop Oil, the civil disobedience group whose supporters have targeted oil terminals, tweeted.

In a Twitter thread, Just Stop Oil continued: “We recognise the significance of the Queen to many people in this country, however, for all us who remain, the climate catastrophe carries on. The cost of living crisis carries on. The lives of millions across the Commonwealth and beyond are threatened.

258,The Guardian,Broadsheet,2022,Just Stop Oil activists blockade four London bridges,"Thousands of supporters of Just Stop Oil have blocked four bridges across the Thames.

Protesters blocked Waterloo Bridge, Westminster Bridge, Lambeth Bridge and Vauxhall Bridge with sit-down protests after marching from 25 points around the centre of London.

Just Stop Oil’s activists said protesters would converge on Westminster, where a crowd led by a samba band had already gathered in Parliament Square. Hundreds had earlier sat on Westminster Bridge, blocking traffic, and moved after police warned them they would be arrested if they stayed.

Among those sitting on Westminster Bridge was Esme Garlake, 26, from London. “I think we are at a real turning point now where the inequalities in our society are so obvious,” she said.

“Today is the day of the energy bills [price rise] coming out and so different groups and grassroots movements are starting to realise that we have to come together to demand social change and climate action.”

Garlake was sat next to her mother, Marilyn Garlake, 59, from Oxford, who said she saw synergies between activism for the climate and cost of living crises. “A tipping point is being reached now,” she said.

“If you look at what’s happening with the cost of living crisis and the climate crisis, everything is coming together, and we have a government that is refusing to take the action that’s needed and making the situation worse.”

The climate activists took to the streets in London as cost of living campaigners Enough Is Enough also held rallies.

The protests come as 200,000 union members walked out of work, with rail unions RMT, Aslef and TSSA, and postal workers’ union the CWU, striking over pay and conditions.

Enough Is Enough, which has been supported by senior figures in the RMT and CWU, as well as prominent leftwing MPs, claims 800,000 people have signed up to support its demands.

It has called for pay rises above inflation, cuts to energy bills, a massive drive to build new homes, support for people who cannot afford food, and more taxes on the richest. Its campaign comes as the government has slashed taxes on the highest earners, and has hinted about massive real-terms cuts to benefits.

On Saturday, the group held rallies in Birmingham, Bristol, Cardiff, Glasgow, Liverpool, Manchester and Norwich.

Just Stop Oil has come into the autumn after a spring and summer of non-violent civil disobedience protests against England’s fuel distribution network.

As part of a coalition of groups, including Insulate Britain, Animal Rebellion, and Jeremy Corbyn’s Peace and Justice Project, it has broadened its demands from an end to all new oil infrastructure to include more taxes on the rich and support with energy bills.

Corbyn, the former Labour leader, drew rapturous applause as he denounced the government’s plans to cut taxes for the richest and benefits for the poorest.

“Our strength is our organisation, our strength is our unity,” Corbyn said. “So let’s stand up for what we believe in.”

Dave Ward, the general secretary of the CWU, said the campaign would pressure the Labour party “into the right place to stand up for working people”.

“Everybody’s job who cares about people in this country to have a fair deal for everything, we have got to build collectivism,” Ward said.

“Are you ready for that? Enough is enough. Let’s get out there: let’s protest, let’s rally. We are going to make change.”

259,The Guardian,Broadsheet,2022,Insulate Britain glue themselves to ground in PMQs-timed protest,"Supporters of Insulate Britain have joined Just Stop Oil protesters on the streets of London, as the chief of the Metropolitan police said daily protests by climate activists had yet to reach a legal threshold of causing “major disruption” required for the force to shut them down.

Just after 11am on Wednesday, about two dozen members of the group, which shot to fame last autumn with a series of blockades of major London roads, walked into the road outside parliament, sat down and glued themselves to the ground.

They defied tight crowd control in Parliament Square, with officers blocking pedestrians from crossing roads, to time their protest to coincide with Liz Truss arriving to attend prime minister’s questions.

Liam Norton, Insulate Britain’s spokesperson, was in handcuffs by the time the Guardian arrived on the scene. He said that despite the group’s demand for a programme to insulate Britain’s homes being vindicated by an escalating cost of living crisis, not enough had been done to answer their call.

“We’re back on the streets because we put forward this policy a year ago [and] there is absolutely no intention from this government to fulfil a national programme of home insulation and retrofit,” Norton, an electrician from London, said.

“At the time what we were saying is it’s going to provide hundreds of thousands of proper meaningful jobs, boost the economy, the Office for National Statistics said 8,500 people froze to death in their homes each year as they can’t afford to heat their homes. That’s only going to get worse as we’ve got this cost of living crisis.”

Insulate Britain’s return to the streets is part of a month-long campaign to “occupy Westminster”, called by Just Stop Oil, a successor group to Insulate Britain that began this year with blockades of fossil fuel distribution terminals.

Protesters, who used superglue to stick their hands to the asphalt, were able to halt traffic outside the Palace of Westminster for more than two hours. Some were expecting a swift return to jail. Ana Heyatawin, 59, said she was already serving a suspended sentence for climate protests.

“I just want them to know that I’m not going away. They can put me in prison as much as they want – they can even kill me if they want,” she said. “I’m just going to sit here until I get the basic insulation for my flat, and other people do too.”

Heyatawin said there was no distinction now between cost of living campaigning and climate campaigning. “Everything has coalesced, it’s all joined together,” she said. “It’s just about social and climate justice for me now, everything is coalescing.”

Wednesday was the 12th day in a row that activists had answered their call with disruptive protest in central London. The protests have been met with fury on many sides, with bystanders and drivers taking matters into their own hands and dragging activists out of the way. Protests on Tuesday were reported to have blocked emergency services , and stopped an unwell baby from being taken to hospital.

In a tweet, the Metropolitan police said it had deployed protest removal teams to unstick protesters from the road in Parliament Square, and on Horseguards, where a smaller group had staged a blockade at the rear entrance to Truss’s residence in Downing Street.


Earlier, the Met commissioner, Sir Mark Rowley, told the London assembly’s police and crime committee that 200 officers a day were being deployed to the protests – but that they did not yet reach the threshold of “major disruption” required to halt them altogether.

He said officers contact Transport for London, local councils and the emergency services several times a day to check the level of disruption caused.

But, he added: “Over the last 11 days, all of those partners have been of a view that it doesn’t cause serious disruption. As soon as we have evidence of that serious disruption either being crossed as a line, or a good prospect of it being crossed, we’ll start being more assertive with our powers.”

Rowley said there have so far been 338 arrests, mainly supporters of Just Stop Oil, but also a few of Animal Rebellion.

“This has been a really difficult operation over the 11 days so far. And it annoys me how much it’s taking away from policing local communities,” he said.

“In 11 days we have put 2,156 officer days into doing this, so that’s a couple of hundred per day roughly.

“That’s an enormous amount of policing resources that aren’t tackling issues that matter to local communities, aren’t dealing with knife crime, aren’t dealing with violence against women and girls.”

260,The Guardian,Broadsheet,2022,‘It was terrifying’: Stop Oil activists on the new battle against fossil fuel,"Four years ago, when Extinction Rebellion started blocking London’s roads in a call for climate action, they brought a DIY carnival atmosphere that transformed their protests into festivals of resistance.

On Thursday morning, when climate activists staged road blocks close to Waterloo, just south of the Thames, they were about two dozen grim-faced campaigners, wearing sensible clothes and hi-vis vests, and enduring abuse from passersby as they tried to superglue their hands to wet asphalt.

They blocked three entrances to St George’s Circus roundabout, one of south London’s busiest junctions. Within minutes, the scene was awash with flashing blue lights, dozens of police, and traffic backing up in all directions.

Just Stop Oil, XR’s latest successor movement, has vowed to block central London roads every day this October. Friday was their 14th consecutive day, and they stepped up tactics once again, with two young women throwing paint over Vincent van Gogh’s Sunflowers painting in the National Gallery , a polarising action that left many aghast. Another action involved spraying the revolving sign at New Scotland Yard, the Metropolitan police headquarters.

Their demand is simple: that the government agree to a moratorium on all new oil and gas projects, in line with a recommendation by the International Energy Agency.

With the government having announced a new round of licensing only last week, their prospects of success seem bleak, but activists remained committed. “The burning of fossil fuels is killing people right now,” Kat, a children’s mental health nurse said as she sat blocking St George’s Circus.

“It’s fuelling the cost of living crisis, and it’s driving temperatures higher and higher. So I will not stand by and watch this government commit crimes against humanity by continuing to invest in the fossil fuel industry. That is morally wrong.

“So I’m sitting here peacefully and non-violently in the road, and our demand is: no new oil and gas.”

Just Stop Oil burst on to the activist scene in April, with an audacious plan to block the distribution of fossil fuels in the south of England with coordinated blockades of the terminals from which they are distributed.

In what they described as a strategic shift from the civil disobedience of XR to a new model of “civil resistance”, from 1 April Just Stop Oil’s supporters took action at up to 10 fuel distribution facilities a day, staging road blocks, committing mass trespasses, digging and occupying tunnels, and clambering aboard tankers.

Within days, local newspapers reported queues and shortages at petrol stations across parts of the Midlands, Kent and Cambridgeshire, and as far afield as Wales. Analysis of official fuel distribution data by the Guardian showed deliveries were down by a fifth across the country. The drop-off was even more precipitous in regions served by terminals targeted by protesters, with deliveries down 43% in the West Midlands, 44% in London and 48% in the east of England.

Just Stop Oil has not come from nowhere. Roger Hallam, the social movement strategist behind XR and Insulate Britain, is also understood to be influential in Just Stop Oil. Many key activists from those previous radical environmental campaigns also appear in Just Stop Oil’s circles. Animal Rebellion, the vegan XR offshoot, lent activists and expertise from their blockades at dairy distributors.

But where XR, and particularly Insulate Britain, relied on a hardcore cadre of older activists, who were prepared to be arrested multiple times, Just Stop Oil was planned as a youth-led campaign. Hallam was reported to be touring universities talking to young people about the climate crisis, and signing them up.

Alex De Koning, from Newcastle, took a break from his PhD in green hydrogen after someone shoved a Just Stop Oil flyer into his hands. “It said: find out what the youth are doing about climate change,” he told the Guardian.

“So I went along. And what I found was really shocking. It was heartbreaking [to learn] how urgent the situation was. But more importantly, how little the government are doing about it, in fact, how much the government are doing to actively make the problem worse for profit. And it changed my life.”

Within a few weeks, De Koning, who had never been to a protest before, found himself running in front of a moving oil tanker, and sitting down for 14 hours glued to a friend blockading a terminal. “It was terrifying,” he said.

But after two-and-half weeks of sustained action at oil terminals, the strain began to show. Oil companies and local councils obtained injunctions banning protests at terminals, allowing police to take action more quickly. In less than a fortnight, the group’s supporters had been arrested nearly 1,000 times.

A few days later Just Stop Oil announced it would be pausing actions. Within a week, they returned to protests at oil terminals, but police were more prepared and were able to contain the disruption. As activists began appearing in court in large numbers, the campaign entered a new phase. Activists took part in targeted actions against art galleries and sports events, while others took part in civil resistance in the courts.

From the beginning, Just Stop Oil has also enjoyed substantial funding. As well as ongoing crowdfunding, Dale Vince, the millionaire founder of green energy company Ecotricity, said he gave them £10,000. Vast amounts more came from the US: the Climate Emergency Fund, a philanthropic fund set up by Aileen Getty, gave them “hundreds of thousands”, its director told the Guardian.

This combination of funding and activist commitment has allowed Just Stop Oil to build up a sophisticated activism operation, with the money to feed, house and transport activists. The organisation has a strategy team, who craft the overall campaign. A mobilisation constantly at work trying to enlist new recruits. Legal teams help activists navigate the legal process once their prosecutions begin, and even help to raise money to pay fines. At the very immediate level, volunteers mobilise to meet activists as they are released from police stations.

“So when people come outside from being arrested, there’s always someone there with a hug, a cup of tea, which is really important,” said De Koning. “So we do try and make sure that everybody is supportive, as much as can be.”

The infrastructure is necessary to support activists through what can be difficult experiences with the prison system. So far, after an estimated 1,600 arrests of supporters, 79 people have been to jail , including on remand, for actions taken with Just Stop Oil. Seven are currently in prison.

As the summer wore on, Just Stop Oil toned down its actions, instead staging smaller, headline-grabbing protests at locations like the British Grand Prix at Silverstone and at art galleries up and down the country. Meanwhile talks began for a return to the streets in October, but in coalition with a wider range of groups, including Jeremy Corbyn’s Peace and Justice Project.

“The idea of the summer was to mobilise and recruit as many people as possible for October so they could do this sustained activism for as long as possible. And also to give some people rest after the very intense April actions,” De Koning said.

The agenda has also evolved. An end to new oil and gas projects remains the key demand, but activists were now calling for subsidised public transport, new taxes on big polluters and basic energy for all.

“There are so many other issues to this, which are all interconnected,” said De Koning. “And especially when we’re dealing with the cost of living crisis that we’re dealing right now is so important to have these demands, which help with both the climate crisis and the cost of living crisis.”

Oscar Berglund, a political scientist at the University of Bristol, who studies social movements, said Just Stop Oil were more explicitly political than previous radical environmental protest groups. Partly that is because “they see a conflict”, he said.

“They see an enemy in the fossil fuel industry, not just the fossil fuel industry, but primarily that.” Just Stop Oil, said Berglund, do not “just see climate change as something that is happening to us, right? But that there is actually a conflict here. [That] some people are driving this and some institutions are causing climate change.”

This distinguishes them from XR, who had explicitly called for a broad coalition to tackle an emergency affecting everyone, or Insulate Britain, whose positive demand for a programme to insulate homes did not attempt to single out villains.

But Just Stop Oil’s return to the busy streets of the metropolis has also won them new enemies. On Thursday morning, passersby could be seen berating activists, asking them how they thought disrupting people’s commutes could bring about structural change.

On Friday, visitors to the National Gallery gasped when Just Stop Oil supporters hurled tomato soup over Van Gogh’s Sunflowers.

“They may be trying to get people to think about the issues but all they end up doing is getting people really annoyed and angry,” said one witness, who declined to give his name. “The typical unthinking individual who doesn’t think about the big issues of the planet is not the kind of person who walks around the National Gallery.”

Even more intense was the social media backlash, where the activists were denounced as “morons”, “idiots” or “punks”. “Effing morons – this is not the way to protest!” Tweeted the former tennis player Martina Navratilova.

Meanwhile, the government has passed new laws in an explicit attempt to curtail their protest activity. The police, crime, sentencing and courts act, passed this year, makes new offences of blocking roads and national infrastructure, and a statutory offence of public nuisance seen to be deliberately targeted at activists.

More is to come. The public order bill, currently before parliament, includes a new offence of “locking on”, where demonstrators attach themselves to something so they cannot be removed, that carries a maximum sentence of up to 51 weeks in prison. Proposed serious disruption prevention orders would ban serial activists from taking part in protests.

Just Stop Oil has also received criticism from within activist circles. Its core strategy of taking disruptive action to be arrested, with the hope it can somehow jam up the judicial system, has been criticised as unrealistic, and naive as to the repressive potential of the state.

It has also been criticised as exclusionary to people of colour and other marginalised communities, whose personal and community experiences with the institutional racism of the police and legal system make them reluctant to take part.

But at St George’s Circus, not everyone was critical. Many passersby thanked the protesters for the action they were taking. Mary, 56, was stood to one side of one blockade, watching the police search protesters’ bags, said she was glad to see the protest in her neighbourhood.

“Brilliant location: high profile, zone 1, one of the most polluted parts of London as well,” she said. “Working-class families need to be made aware of what is happening with fossil fuels, because we inhale this day to day.

“Anything that raises awareness is important, so I’m happy to see this here today.”",Left-center Bias,1,1829,"‘It was terrifying’: Stop Oil activists on the new battle against fossil fuelFour years ago, when Extinction Rebellion started blocking London’s roads in a call for climate action, they brought a DIY carnival atmosphere that transformed their protests into festivals of resistance.

On Thursday morning, when climate activists staged road blocks close to Waterloo, just south of the Thames, they were about two dozen grim-faced campaigners, wearing sensible clothes and hi-vis vests, and enduring abuse from passersby as they tried to superglue their hands to wet asphalt.

They blocked three entrances to St George’s Circus roundabout, one of south London’s busiest junctions. Within minutes, the scene was awash with flashing blue lights, dozens of police, and traffic backing up in all directions.

Just Stop Oil, XR’s latest successor movement, has vowed to block central London roads every day this October. Friday was their 14th consecutive day, and they stepped up tactics once again, with two young women throwing paint over Vincent van Gogh’s Sunflowers painting in the National Gallery , a polarising action that left many aghast. Another action involved spraying the revolving sign at New Scotland Yard, the Metropolitan police headquarters.

Their demand is simple: that the government agree to a moratorium on all new oil and gas projects, in line with a recommendation by the International Energy Agency.

With the government having announced a new round of licensing only last week, their prospects of success seem bleak, but activists remained committed. “The burning of fossil fuels is killing people right now,” Kat, a children’s mental health nurse said as she sat blocking St George’s Circus.

“It’s fuelling the cost of living crisis, and it’s driving temperatures higher and higher. So I will not stand by and watch this government commit crimes against humanity by continuing to invest in the fossil fuel industry. That is morally wrong.

“So I’m sitting here peacefully and non-violently in the road, and our demand is: no new oil and gas.”

Just Stop Oil burst on to the activist scene in April, with an audacious plan to block the distribution of fossil fuels in the south of England with coordinated blockades of the terminals from which they are distributed.

In what they described as a strategic shift from the civil disobedience of XR to a new model of “civil resistance”, from 1 April Just Stop Oil’s supporters took action at up to 10 fuel distribution facilities a day, staging road blocks, committing mass trespasses, digging and occupying tunnels, and clambering aboard tankers.

Within days, local newspapers reported queues and shortages at petrol stations across parts of the Midlands, Kent and Cambridgeshire, and as far afield as Wales. Analysis of official fuel distribution data by the Guardian showed deliveries were down by a fifth across the country. The drop-off was even more precipitous in regions served by terminals targeted by protesters, with deliveries down 43% in the West Midlands, 44% in London and 48% in the east of England.

Just Stop Oil has not come from nowhere. Roger Hallam, the social movement strategist behind XR and Insulate Britain, is also understood to be influential in Just Stop Oil. Many key activists from those previous radical environmental campaigns also appear in Just Stop Oil’s circles. Animal Rebellion, the vegan XR offshoot, lent activists and expertise from their blockades at dairy distributors.

But where XR, and particularly Insulate Britain, relied on a hardcore cadre of older activists, who were prepared to be arrested multiple times, Just Stop Oil was planned as a youth-led campaign. Hallam was reported to be touring universities talking to young people about the climate crisis, and signing them up.

Alex De Koning, from Newcastle, took a break from his PhD in green hydrogen after someone shoved a Just Stop Oil flyer into his hands. “It said: find out what the youth are doing about climate change,” he told the Guardian.

“So I went along. And what I found was really shocking. It was heartbreaking [to learn] how urgent the situation was. But more importantly, how little the government are doing about it, in fact, how much the government are doing to actively make the problem worse for profit. And it changed my life.”

Within a few weeks, De Koning, who had never been to a protest before, found himself running in front of a moving oil tanker, and sitting down for 14 hours glued to a friend blockading a terminal. “It was terrifying,” he said.

But after two-and-half weeks of sustained action at oil terminals, the strain began to show. Oil companies and local councils obtained injunctions banning protests at terminals, allowing police to take action more quickly. In less than a fortnight, the group’s supporters had been arrested nearly 1,000 times.

A few days later Just Stop Oil announced it would be pausing actions. Within a week, they returned to protests at oil terminals, but police were more prepared and were able to contain the disruption.

261,The Guardian,Broadsheet,2022,"If you’re outraged by XR and Just Stop Oil, imagine how disruptive climate breakdown will be","Disruptive political activism, from strikes to boycotts to road occupations, always makes enemies. That’s part of the point: confrontations and controversies mean publicity. More ambitiously, stunts and provocations by activists are also meant to remind the public that the status quo itself is built on disruptions. Even supposedly cautious governments are constantly altering the distribution of power and wealth, and the environment itself.

Four years since the founding of Extinction Rebellion, known by its highly committed members as XR, climate activists in Britain and many other countries are still launching waves of protests: blocking roads, throwing food over famous artworks, gluing themselves to surfaces in public places and spray-painting banks that invest in fossil fuels. New groups have appeared with XR-style tactics and goals: Just Stop Oil, Insulate Britain, Animal Rebellion, Youth Climate Swarm. A steady stream of activists from teenagers to pensioners are prepared to face arrest and imprisonment in order to press governments, businesses and voters to change their behaviour.

Yet even though the climate crisis has worsened faster than many pessimistic analysts expected, and even though the official response to it remains far too slow, the work of XR and its successors still enrages many people. There are endless online videos of activists being dragged off the road by drivers, or being dangerously shunted by vehicles, or simply being shouted at by passersby. The print and broadcast media are full of similar denunciations. Tory and Labour politicians compete to be the least tolerant of disruptive climate activism – even though Labour’s opposition to the expansion of our oil and gas fields mirrors the stance of Just Stop Oil.

The constant attacks on the activists are inadvertently revealing. They are called “selfish”, when they are sacrificing far more for the environment than their critics. They are called “extremists”, despite the world’s ever more extreme weather. They are dismissed as middle-class dilettantes, yet also feared as fanatical members of a cult. They are condemned for interfering with “people going about their daily business”, as the presenter Mark Austin put it with an air of outrage on Sky News, even though our everyday habits are a central cause of the crisis.

Underlying all these criticisms is a strong but unstated desire not to engage with the activists’ main argument: that the climate emergency is so huge and urgent that modest changes to our lifestyles and conventional political action – from summits such as Cop27 to marches to polite negotiations between governments and companies – are no longer enough. On the videos of drivers confronting activists, the drivers’ fury feels about more than their vehicles being blocked. British motorists are used to obstructions and delays. The anger suggests resentment at being reminded about the climate crisis. It also acts as a way of avoiding being drawn into conversation with the protesters – a conversation that might be uncomfortable or frightening. Starting with XR’s brutally frank name, disruptive green activism presents what the US climate campaigner Al Gore once called An Inconvenient Truth.

Critics of the movement often underestimate how much support it has. An official “factsheet” justifying the government’s public order bill – legislation intended to hinder “protest groups such as Just Stop Oil and Insulate Britain” – cites an opinion poll from April. While the survey shows that twice as many people support as oppose “tougher laws to tackle climate change activists blocking roads, transport and other infrastructure”, it also shows that among 18- to 34-year-olds, opinion on the issue is evenly divided. Many of those likely to be most affected by the climate crisis, and likely to become an ever more important part of the electorate, do not see disruptive protest as illegitimate.

In fact, a small but increasingly influential minority of green activists and thinkers argue that XR and similar groups are not disruptive enough. Last year the Swedish environmentalist Andreas Malm published How to Blow Up a Pipeline , a seductively well-written and well-researched book that argues climate activists should abandon their longstanding “commitment to absolute non-violence”, and instead “escalate” their campaign by “physically attacking the things that consume our planet”, such as fossil fuel infrastructure. Citing previous successful protest movements that have used sabotage, such as the suffragettes, Malm advocates violence against property, not people, to create an “inhospitable investment climate” for fossil fuel projects. The pressure on businesses and governments to switch to green technologies, he argues, would then be irresistible.

It’s not hard to find things to worry about in Malm’s argument. Wouldn’t the sabotage have to be on an enormous scale? How are governments and voters likely to react, given the fury already aroused by XR? How would violence against people be avoided, when many oil and gas facilities have security guards? And would the whole process of forcing companies to abandon their expensive fossil fuel investments be as straightforward as he claims?

Yet what Malm advocates is already happening. In June, a group called Pipe Busters broke into a building site for a new aviation fuel pipeline from Southampton to London and damaged sections of uninstalled pipe and a construction vehicle. Similar actions have happened in other countries. Meanwhile, protests by supposedly nonviolent groups have begun to include attacks on property. In April, Just Stop Oil activists vandalised petrol pumps along the M25.

It’s possible to see such actions as token, and likely to be counter-productive: feeding the panic about climate activism that will be institutionalised by the public order bill, and probably by further authoritarian legislation after that.

If you’re more optimistic, it’s possible to argue that since parties such as Labour and the US Democrats are now in favour of changing the economy to stabilise the climate, disruptive protests to draw attention to the issue are no longer required.

But even if you have that much faith in centre-left politics, the response to the protests has not been reassuring. The fury of drivers may be a foretaste of how many voters will respond when and if governments really start addressing the climate crisis, by requiring big changes in our everyday lives. Before it’s too late, the road-blockers and the reformers need to realise they’re on the same side

262,The Guardian,Broadsheet,2022,"Animal Rebellion occupies Gordon Ramsay’s three-star Michelin restaurant
","Climate crisis activists occupied Gordon Ramsay’s three-star Michelin restaurant in London’s Chelsea on Saturday evening to protest at the “perfect inequality” such high-end dining venues represent.

Members of Animal Rebellion entered Restaurant Gordon Ramsay on Royal Hospital Road, Chelsea at about 6pm.

They sat at tables reserved for guests and held mock menus outlining the environmental costs of items on the restaurant’s menu, including steak and veal.

In a statement, the group said that they are campaigning for a plant-based food system and the creation of a mass-rewilding programme.

Lucia Alexander, a 39-year-old auxiliary nurse from the east of England who took part in the action, said: “This restaurant is the perfect example of the inequality we face in the UK right now.

“While Gordon Ramsay serves food costing a minimum of £155 per person, more than 2 million people are relying on food banks in this cost of living crisis.

“Instead of restaurants making colossal profits at the expense of animals, workers, and our climate, we need to feed everyone by supporting farmers and fishing communities in a transition to a plant-based food system.

“A plant-based food system requires 75% less farmland to grow food, allowing us to feed millions of additional people without the reliance on exploitative and inefficient animal farming industries. This is the answer to the cost of living and climate crises.”

The group said that 14 activists took part in the protest, and added: “At 8pm the restaurant closed for business and the protesters left peacefully through the front door.”

The Metropolitan police said they were called to the restaurant shortly before 6.30pm “to reports of a group of protesters refusing to leave the premises”.

It added: “The restaurant was closed and the protesters left. There were no arrests.”

A spokesperson for Restaurant Gordon Ramsay said that reservations were cancelled and service was so disrupted that the restaurant had to close.

The spokesperson added: “Everyone is entitled to their opinions and beliefs. However, to force your way into a restaurant, disturbing hard-working staff going about their jobs and ruining the evening of guests who have waited months for their reservations is incredibly inappropriate and deeply disrespectful.”

On whose authority are they making those demands other than that of a tiny minority of the population which has chosen to espouse the vegan creed? (For the moment. While it's fashionable.)

As I have said before, if you don't want to eat meat, that's fine.

Pass me your share and enjoy the lentils. But don't preach and screech your warped doctrine in my ears because all that is going to do is to erode what small reserves of empathy I have for your cause. Naturally, however, I would defend with vigour your right to adhere to it.

Of course I can see the flawed logic behind choosing McDonald's. It's one of the best-known names in the fast food business, its stores are the most visited, and therefore the effects of any disruption are likely to be experienced by the maximum number of people.

A lot of bang for the buck, in other words, but McDonald's customers represent a very faithful clientele mainly consisting of confirmed carnivores who are not going to take too kindly to their double quarterpounders with cheese suddenly not being available.

Indeed, such might be their annoyance at being deprived that they could well harden their attitudes against the minority of ethical 'warriors' who were responsible for the dearth.

Life should have taught us all that you simply do not carry people with you by seeking to impose your beliefs in this way, and particularly by insisting on an international corporation which has bestowed all the benefits of the Big Mac on mankind adopting a sourcing and sales policy which is diametrically opposed to its current, long-standing one - and all within the space of three years. Get real.

Anyway, the last time I checked, McDonald's credentials seemed pretty sound, with the beef being either English or Irish and the eggs free-range.

There is, of course, the matter of whether what it sells is actually wholesome.

I certainly would not recommend anyone availing themselves of its gastronomic delights on a daily basis, though in all honesty I don't regard someone making an occasional purchase as putting their health at any kind of risk.

But nutrition evidently wasn't the issue here - and in any case don't get me started on the nutritional deficiencies which have been highlighted in some vegan products.

You would have thought, if these people had any sense, they would have chosen a decent target, such as Uncle Sam's industrialisation of hormone-rich beef production, which leads to so much deforestation in order to plant soy beans for feed.

But then they might find it difficult to criticise the production of the very legume which they consume in various forms as an acceptable alternative to real meat, might they not?

Campaigners poured red paint inside Farlows, a hunting and fishing shop on Pall Mall, and daubed paint on the windows of William Evans, a shooting supply shop in nearby St James's Street, while others took and emptied milk from supermarkets.

The group, an offshoot of Extinction Rebellion, describes itself as a ""mass movement using non-violent civil disobedience to call for a just, sustainable plant-based food system"".

After putting out a message ""calling all vegans to occupy London"", AR said protesters brought London's West End ""to a standstill"" as people marched from Green Park to Piccadilly Circus.

They are calling on Prime Minister Liz Truss and Environment Secretary Ranil Jayawardena to tackle what they call the ""climate, ecological and cost-of-living crises"".

Fellow environmental campaigners from Just Stop Oil were also seen blocking a road on Park Lane in central London as part of their efforts to stop future gas and oil projects from proceeding.

It comes after two activists from Animal Rebellion targeted Fortnum & Mason and Selfridges and poured milk out in the high-end department stores in central London on Friday.

Dillon Parsons, 21, from Preston, a spokesperson for AR and a film production student at the University for the Creative Arts, said he has been involved with the campaign group for two years.

On Friday afternoon, he said: ""We are currently at Trafalgar Square.

""There are, I'd say, a couple of hundred activists and we are all sat on the ground and demanding that the Government transition to a plant-based future because the UK Government has proved that they don't know how to respond to crises any more.""

""We know that animal farming and fishing is the key cause to the climate crisis, so if we transition away to a plant-based food system we can not only stop 76 billion animals a year from being killed, we can feed the whole population several times over, we can free up 76% of global agricultural land... to give every person and all future generations a chance of having a better future on this planet.""

277,The Western Mail,Broadsheet,2022,AR is about nonviolent civil disobedience,"WITH reference to Paul Mercer's recent letter, 'Disgusted by antics of Animal Rebellion', I'd like the chance to write a short reply.

Animal Rebellion is committed to nonviolence. It is a commitment to not intentionally harm any living being, human or otherwise.

Nonviolent civil disobedience, as effectively used by the Indian Independence movement and Civil Rights movement to name just two, has been shown to successfully achieve change when other methods have failed. The actions during the past week and before reflected the principles of nonviolence, where individuals took care to only cause damage to property, take full accountability for their actions, and to show their hope for a better future where nature thrives.

We're at a crossroads in history and those who hold power have resolved to turn us all towards a cliff. Yet this isn't an inevitable outcome! We have academics from Oxford, Harvard, and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change showing us that the key solution to the climate and ecological emergencies is to support farmers in a transition to a plant-based food system and rewilding the 76% of global farmland that would be freed up by this!

Think about it, we could produce more local food, sustainably, and also make the UK carbon-negative whilst restoring beautiful nature across the country. This begins with the Government stepping up and showing genuine support for farmers. Animal Rebellion has had a team led by co-founder Dan Kidby in constant conversation with independent farmers, listening to their concerns and worries.

None of this progress or dialogue would've happened without supporters of Animal Rebellion stepping into civil disobedience and creating headlines.

278,The Western Mail,Broadsheet,2022,Farm protesters call for sustainable future,"HUNDREDS of farm workers and environmental activists have marched through central London in support of sustainable farming.

Members of the Landworkers' Alliance and other farming groups marched from Parliament Square, up Whitehall and past Buckingham Palace on Saturday. They were led by Gerald Miles, a 74-year-old organic farmer who travelled to London from his South Wales farm in a tractor that was built in 1967.

Mr Miles, who headed up the march from his tractor - which he calls Bess, said: ""We need nature in farming because we're in a climate change crisis.""

He added that it was vital for the Government to keep its Environmental Land Management subsidy schemes (ELMs), designed to replace the European Union's common agricultural policy, as they ""promote nature in farming"".

The farmer, from St Davids in Pembrokeshire, spent four days travelling to the capital in his 55-year-old tractor that still has its original clutch. Mr Miles said: ""It was over 380 miles on A and B roads. It's taken me four days because I could only do 60 to 70 miles a day - she only travels 15 miles an hour.""

The farmer, who is part of the Caerhys Organic Community Agriculture group, said he would be ""cheating"" on his way back to South Wales by putting the tractor, which has no roof, on a trailer.

The list of demands made by those marching included a ""right to food"" to be put into UK law, more Government support schemes for young people and marginalised groups to enter farming, and a bigger budget for agricultural support schemes with ELMs.

Jyoti Fernandes, Landworkers' Alliance policy and campaigns coordinator and one of the lead organisers of the march, said: ""We need the ELM scheme, which is currently under threat by the new Government, to be fully supported - and farmers given the advice and support they need to transition to a climate-friendly farming system.""

Vicki Herd, head of farming at the Sustain Alliance, said: ""We face a huge crisis with climate change and the collapse of nature and yet we continually see Government faffing around - farmers need long-term planning and security.""

The march was organised by the Landworkers' Alliance in collaboration with more than a dozen other food and agriculture organisations, including Save British Farming, the Sustain Alliance and the Nature- Friendly Farming Network.

The march came as Animal Rebellion protesters poured milk on to shop floors, displays and products across the country, including Harrods, in an effort to persuade the Government to back a move to a plant-based diet.

The group co-ordinated the action in stores like Waitrose, Whole Foods and Marks and Spencer in London, Manchester, Norwich and Edinburgh just before 12pm on Saturday. Several protesters poured milk, taken from the shelves, on to display cabinets in Harrods' food hall in Knightsbridge, London.

The list of demands made by those marching included a ""right to food"" to be put into UK law, more Government support schemes for young people and marginalised groups to enter farming, and a bigger budget for agricultural support schemes with ELMs.

Jyoti Fernandes, Landworkers' Alliance policy and campaigns coordinator and one of the lead organisers of the march, said: ""We need the ELM scheme, which is currently under threat by the new Government, to be fully supported - and farmers given the advice and support they need to transition to a climate-friendly farming system.""

Vicki Herd, head of farming at the Sustain Alliance, said: ""We face a huge crisis with climate change and the collapse of nature and yet we continually see Government faffing around - farmers need long-term planning and security.""

The march was organised by the Landworkers' Alliance in collaboration with more than a dozen other food and agriculture organisations, including Save British Farming, the Sustain Alliance and the Nature- Friendly Farming Network.

The march came as Animal Rebellion protesters poured milk on to shop floors, displays and products across the country, including Harrods, in an effort to persuade the Government to back a move to a plant-based diet.

The group co-ordinated the action in stores like Waitrose, Whole Foods and Marks and Spencer in London, Manchester, Norwich and Edinburgh just before 12pm on Saturday. Several protesters poured milk, taken from the shelves, on to display cabinets in Harrods' food hall in Knightsbridge, London.

279,The Western Mail,Broadsheet,2022,Campaigners fight... while wildlife suffers,"ANOTHER weekend of protests allegedly aimed at protecting the environment have taken place, with a range of different targets and a hotch-potch of causes apparently fought for.

Increasingly, however, the mix of bandwagon jumpers, out-and-out anarchists and genuinely concerned demonstrators is making the majority of the population angry, confused and, in the end, turned off the whole issue.

While the protesters can rightly claim that throwing paint over priceless paintings, gluing themselves to the road and tipping fresh milk around in shops and supermarkets gets them publicity, how much benefit is it really bringing to the range of causes they support?

Two demonstrations in particular in London last Saturday highlight the grave danger that those who purport to have broadly the same aims really need to more carefully consider a coordinated approach if they want to make Britain a cleaner, greener nation.

While farm workers and those linked to conservation and food pro- duction were marching in one part of the capital, Animal Rebellion, an offshoot of the climate change protest group, Extinction Rebellion, was pouring fresh milk over the floor in smart shops and calling for a switch to a ""plant-based future.""

Much actually unites these two groups. Both say they want a more sustainable countryside. Yet the fixation among the Animal Rebellion crowd is for that countryside to be devoid of livestock and our diets free of any animal products. As a result, many of the farm workers calling for regenerative and sustainable agriculture - and well placed to bring it about, with help - will never see the anti-meat and milk crowd as anything other than the enemy.

The weekend before, Animal Rebellion trashed smart shops selling fishing and shooting attire in central London. Yet many who spend money in such shops are passionate country lovers, engaged in conservation, alongside rural sports.

Many are as concerned about the future of rural Britain, its landscape and wildlife, as any committed Animal Rebellion demonstrator claims to be. One small example underlines the point. Fishing tackle maker Orvis raises money and awareness to help reduce plastic pollution in rivers. Orvis fishing equipment is sold in Farlows of Pall Mall - one of the shops trashed by the protesters.

If Animal Rebellion wants to protest about shooting and fishing and condemn those who eat meat and drink milk, that's its choice. But dressing up those views as the only way to 'save the planet' is dishonest.

It muddies the waters for those who agree that we need to take action on wildlife, the climate and the countryside, but cannot accept there is only one route to that destination, which must involve the eradication of all livestock farming and an end to putting land to use for country sports.

Protest and pressure groups can win support and whip up anger to help their fundraising and membership drives by condemning others who don't precisely share their views.

The result, however, means a very broad swathe of campaigners who share the same general aims for a better countryside and more wildlife effectively cancel each other out.

And this failing is not confined to what might be considered the extremists. The RSPB, the National Trust and the Wildlife Trusts, all of which would once have been considered mainstream with significant membership numbers spanning a very broad church, now seem increasingly ready to identify themselves by what and who they oppose.

Tackling environmental degradation, restoring wildlife and building a strong and sustainable countryside cannot be achieved by adopting a single dogmatic approach or pursuing a narrow special interest.

Working together and accepting differences while seeing the bigger picture and making common cause is the way to really make a difference. We need to learn that lesson, fast.

He has the colossal cheek to claim that ""AR is committed to nonviolence, it is a commitment not to intentionally harm any living being human or otherwise"", yet at the end of his letter he condones this very thing by saying that ""none of this progress or dialogue would have happened without supporters of AR stepping into civil disobedience and creating headlines.""

He then proceeds to have the nerve to try to justify these actions by giving us a lecture on veganism and climate change and stating that ""individuals took care to only cause damage to property""!

Does Mr McGovern really believe that attacking buildings and shop windows with paint, gluing themselves to the road and other ridiculous stunts is going to change the mind of the general public, to whom these actions cause so much trouble?

Is he proud of holding up emergency vehicles and ruining shop carpets by pouring milk over them; is he really saying that damaging other people's property is all in a good cause?

This is not about climate change, veganism or stopping oil; like many other 'protests' in the past the original good intentions have been hijacked by the far left and anarchist brigade, who see this as an opportunity to engage in their own 'class war' against the wealthy.

It is no coincidence that all the West End shops that were attacked were ones that sold very expensive goods to those who can afford them and that these 'demonstrators' also showed their contempt for the law and the police by spraying paint over the New Scotland Yard sign, otherwise what reason would they have to deface a police station?

All the actions in the name of veganism can only give veganism a bad name.

As for the 'Stop Oil' idiots, if any of them actually thought about the consequences of stopping oil they would soon realise that, by doing so, the entire country stops - no transport, no manufacturing, no imports or exports by ships or aircraft, in fact practically anything that uses or is oil-based would cease.

We all have the right to protest, but in a democracy that right must be exercised within the law, as laid down by the representatives of the people.

If the law is wrong, it is for Parliament to change it, not for individuals to arrogate to themselves the right to ignore the rules the rest of us are expected to observe.

Animal Rebellion spokesperson Nathan McGovern seeks to justify the disruptive antics of his organisation by asserting that they are committed to ""non-violent"" action to make their case for a plantbased food system.

The mere fact that activists choose to adopt methods falling short of personal violence is no excuse. Intentional damage to the property of others, deliberately destroying food products (at a time when many families are struggling to feed themselves) and obstructing people going about their lawful business, including preventing them from attending medical and other important appointments, is not only unlawful but also, to my mind, amounts to controlling, coercive behaviour calculated to bully the nation into adopting a lifestyle that the activists have chosen for them. At best, this amounts to breathtaking arrogance; at worst, it seems a step on the road to totalitarianism.

A cynic might be forgiven for thinking that this activism is little more than extremist animal rights ideology dressed up as concern for the planet. Whether or not that is the case, it is difficult to see how damaging and destroying property and obstructing the highway can possibly bring people on board. These antics risk doing huge damage to the case for reducing our impact on our planet.

We can all play our part - perhaps deciding to raise a smaller family; recycling and upcycling; making things last instead of buying the latest; reducing our consumption of utilities; cutting down on travel for leisure purposes; and, yes, even reducing our consumption of certain products.

282,The Western Mail,Broadsheet,2022,"For change to happen, people must rise up","YOU ask whether Animal Rebellion's tactics are misguided. At a point when we have just three years for the Government to take meaningful action to prevent the worst of climate change there seems no other way than to speak loudly about what must be done. Inaction is not an option, but the Government refuses to even talk about changing the unsustainable politics of growth and greed.

Right now, farmers are trapped in systems where they must keep doing what they are doing to qualify for subsidies that are unsustainable and will soon lead to our ruin.

The actual demands of Animal Rebellion couldn't be more reasonable: support farmers to transition to a plant-based food system where they will be able to make a living and we would no longer need to use excessive amounts of land for grazing and growing animal feed.

Then, with the 76% of global farmland freed up, we should rewild to draw down carbon from the atmosphere, restore nature and bring back wildlife.

This isn't about telling people what to do: at no point do Animal Rebellion say that people must be vegan. This is telling the Government that it must put significant changes in place or we have no liveable future.

But the Government are ignoring even their own scientists' advice to phase out animal agriculture and therefore feel Animal Rebellion's tactics are proportional to the urgency of the situation we are all in.

Complacency is just not going to get us out of this and neither is hoping a petition will do the trick. History shows over and over again that in order for change to happen, people must rise up.

In this context, the pouring away of milk in supermarkets demonstrates the absolute waste - of money propping up an unsustainable industry, of land and feed grown to feed cows and, most of all, the waste of cow's lives.

Milk is wasted the minute it is taken away from the calf it is intended for and instead sold to humans as food. The lives of these animals are made intolerable by our demand for milk (do a bit of research to see what the life of a dairy cow is like...).

Dorset Police said Emma Smart, 45, was arrested on Thursday evening after allegedly causing a disturbance and refusing to comply with officers after they asked her to leave Catch At The Old Fish Market in Weymouth. Animal Rebellion, the protest group behind Smart, said she approached the table where Sir David was dining in an attempt to deliver a letter to him, and shared images of her being dragged away by police at 8.45pm.

Smart, an ecologist from Weymouth, said she wanted a five-minute conversation with Sir David about the need to address climate change.

She said in a statement: ""The Catch is a symbol of excess and inequality in today's world, Weymouth has average wages amongst the lowest in the UK and is at huge risk of sea level rises.

284,The Western Mail,Broadsheet,2022,Restaurant protests leave a sour taste,"THERE could be any number of reasons for staging a protest in one of celebrity chef Gordon Ramsay's restaurants. To complain at the eye-watering prices, maybe, or make a stand against Mr Ramsay's foul-mouth rants which were once a feature of his TV shows.

But targeting his three Michelinstarred establishment in Chelsea to make a point about climate change seems to me to make very little sense. It serves as yet another example of the woolly-headed thinking of those engaged in supposedly highlighting the climate emergency.

The members of Animal Rebellion - who turned up at Restaurant Gordon Ramsay, sat down at reserved tables and held up mock menus highlighting the so-called ""environmental cost"" of items like steak and veal - said they were campaigning for a plant based food system.

Aside from the fact that the evidence for abandoning all meat as a way of reducing the climate crisis is scant at best, choosing to target a smart restaurant over, say, a fastfood chain makes this protest more about class and wealth, than the warming planet. Mr Ramsay almost certainly sources his meat from suppliers with impeccable environmental credentials. Pound to a penny it is grass fed, slow growing and just about as 'green' as any meat can be. At Mr Ramsay's prices, it needs to be.

Of course serving meals at £155 a head when two million people are relying on food banks is an example of the inequalities in the world. But that, too, has nothing much to do with climate change or the fight to lower the world's carbon footprint.

Taken to its logical conclusion, Animal Rebellion, Extinction Rebellion and all other other splinter groups from the climate emergency protest groups need to rail against ever single aspect of modern life - including their own lives - if they are using a London restaurant as an example of why the earth is warming. And they need to look far beyond Britain's shores if they are to identify the real culprits, who are still burning coal and expanding their fossil fuel industries while Britain makes significant progress in reducing emissions, year-by-year.

Animal Rebellion is, pretty clearly, an animal rights organisation that wants to end meat eating, the production of milk and shut down other industries that rely on animal products. That's been a well-trodden cause for decades - but don't confuse it with work towards limiting global warming.

The fact that another protester, this time in Weymouth, Dorset, had to be dragged from a smart fish restaurant where she was trying to barrack no less a person than Sir David Attenborough for daring to enjoy dinner, underlines the point.

Few people have done more than Sir David to highlight the dangers of climate change and bring home to the masses the impact that humankind is having on the planet.

He understands that forgoing a fish dinner would not make a jot of difference to the climate battle and that there are many sustainable species of fish that can be enjoyed with a clear conscience. Others should follow his lead.

From the demonstrators who climb gantries over busy motorways, preventing ordinary people from going about their business, to those who 'occupy' restaurants and rail against diners enjoying a meal, these climate protests are making more and more people angry and increasingly disengaged from the issues at hand.

The crisis is real, the measures being taken to ameliorate it - on a global scale - too slow and the reasons for that are obvious. We have built a world on fossil fuels and to go cold turkey at too fast a rate would cause as many problems as failing to act at all.

The focus must be on genuine measures that will work, both to slow the rate of warming and prepare the world for what's coming. It might be fun for a few rebels to make a stand against expensive meals in smart restaurants and highlight the excesses of a few wealthy diners.

Don't believe me? Check the viral footage on social media of the young man in Croydon, south London, stopped, searched and detained as he wasn't 'dressed for the climate'.

Nothing was found but he was stopped again just two days later. A complaint was made by the young man and is being investigated.

We are also still waiting for accountability over the distressing case of Child Q, the 15-year-old schoolgirl who, two years ago, was strip-searched by police at school while on her period without another adult present. Again, nothing was found.

We are starting to sound more like the troubled US every day. Black people are still nine times more likely to be stopped and searched by police than white people, official figures for England and Wales in 2019-2020 show.

But then when Baroness Casey's new report into misconduct in the Met reveals a culture of racism and misogyny, is there any surprise that officers are abusing their position?

Black officers were 81% more likely than their white counterparts to face misconduct allegations. Asians were 55% more likely.

And that's before you even get to the many claims of sexual misconduct, misogyny, racism and homophobia that the report found were badly mishandled.

It is heartbreaking to accept that sections of the very people tasked with protecting us are making judgments on how to do so based on our skin colour.

","A WAR veteran blasted Extinction Rebellion protesters yesterday for ruining aVIP reunion honouring fallen comrades.

Former staff sergeant Alan Guy, 87, and his disabled wife Lyn, 82, were stuck in a taxi for over an hour trying to reach the gala event in the centre of London.

Blockades set up by climate change demonstrators prevented them getting anywhere near the venue and eventually they were driven back to their hotel in the rain - to munch sadly on a sandwich.

Alan said: ""It was a disaster. There was just no way of getting there.

""These inconsiderate people cost me a total of £210 out of my pension for a wasted event. I hope that they all sleep peacefully in their beds tonight.""

Veterans of the 1950-53 Korean War had travelled from all over Britain for the event at the Corinthia Hotel INWHITEHALL.

Finery But most were halted by blockades and it is thought only actually four made it to the VIP reception, which was hosted by the South Korean ambassador and attended by dignitaries and diplomats.

Alan and Lyn, from Byfleet, Surrey, were staying less than two miles from the fivestar hotel - a distance that normally takes 15 minutes in a cab.

Alan, who served in the Royal Army Medical Corps and was awarded an MBE in 2011 for services to veterans, added: ""After an hour the driver said he could drop us off somewhere and we could walk in the rain but my wife is disabled.

""I was wearing my medals and we were in all our finery but in the end we went back to our hotel and ate a sandwich.""

Another veteran only made it to the ceremony by pushing his wife nearly a mile in a wheelchair through the rain.

The reunion blow came as the Met Police were accused of losing control of the activists. One furious ex-Home Office minister questioned if Commissioner Cressida Dick was up to the job.

Peers in the House of Lords rounded on Scotland Yard, condemning senior officers for not taking a strong enough approach to Extinction Rebellion (XR) demonstrators.

Some members of the Lords were forced to stay in the building overnight because they were hemmed in by the protests.

And Government minister Baroness Williams admitted it was ""monstrous"" sick patients were not able to reach St Thomas' Hospital because XR were blocking Westminster Bridge and roads around it. Police have insisted they are taking a more ""robust"" approach to the activists and have made more than 500 arrests since the campaign began on Monday morning.

Officers started using scissors to cut them out of tents, with anyone refusing to leave warned they would be arrested.

Lord Forsyth, who served as Home Office Minister under Sir John Major, said colleagues had been stuck in the House and there had been huge congestion, disruption and pollution. He added: ""Is this another example of the Commissioner doing her best and it not being good enough?"" Baroness Boothroyd added: ""As a young person I carried the banner at many demonstrations but the police were in control of me as a demonstrator. Now it seems the demonstrators are in control of the police.""

Activists glued themselves to the Department for Transport and the lobby of the Home Office yesterday as many vowed to remain in makeshift campsites.

An XR lorry, parked outside the Home Office, became a focal point for some demonstrators.

Activist John Curran, a former Met Police detective sergeant, said he was willing to be arrested for his beliefs.

Meanwhile a linked protest by Animal Rebellion saw Smithfield meat market clogged by tents and its stalls covered in fruit and vegetables.

But Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said: ""It cannot be right that people are able to set up tents in the middle of the street and then not simply be removed.""

Well, apart from the fact that milk is destroying the planet - no, really - it's because milk is racist, explained my guest. ""What? Is that because it's white?"" I wondered. Well that's a new angle on so-called ""white privilege"". But, no. It's because many people of colour are lactose intolerant, he said.

So it's an evil plot to keep people of colour downtrodden by making them drink something that makes them poorly, according to this bunch of numpties who want to have milk production stopped because they say it is ""a racist drug"".

And these are the people who want to forcefeed us vegetables.

You won't be surprised that even fellow vegans think Mr Speers and his co-nutters are as thick as mince, sorry, minced tofu, following their Harrods tantrum.",Right,0,362,"Who's crying over 'racist' spilled milk?JUST WHEN you thought the various ""rebellion"" protest groups could not get any more stupid, along comes the organisation Animal Rebellion. I say ""organisation"", but it's more a bunch of kids who have got together to talk complete rubbish about climate change and everything else related to it.

They align themselves with Extinction Rebellion but their particular specialism in the crowded field of pointless anti-social activities is a desire to ban us all from eating meat, fish and dairy and force us all to be vegan.

Animal farming, they say, is a major cause of climate change and, according to their tinpot plan, farms should only be allowed to produce vegetables and to re-wild their spare fields.

Apparently we are already well on the way to becoming a totally plant-based society, according to the plant-brained bloke who came on my TALKTV show to lecture me about it.

Tim Speers was talking at me in that way people do when they have no concept of debate - speaking without taking a breath just in case someone else might want to put an alternative view.

This is the man who, with others, tipped milk all over the floor of the Harrods food hall last month in protest against, er, milk.

310,The Evening Standard ,Tabloid,2019,"Druids and drums: my day as a Rebel; Closing airports, occupying Smithfield and mass arrests - and that's only week one of Extinction Rebellion's October uprising. Samuel Fishwick infiltrates the nerve centre
","STANDING at the centre of Extinction Rebellion's Trafalgar Square camp at 11pm, I feel like I'm at a festival. Granted, alcohol is noticeably absent - organisers have banned drink and drugs - but comedian Nish Kumar delivers an uproarious impromptu stand-up set, and 10 teenagers dance merrily to a silent disco beneath waving flags (their flashing headphones are playing Fat Boy Slim mashed up with Greta Thunberg's UN address). No one is going anywhere else soon.

A fortnight is a long time to bring any city to a standstill. But Extinction Rebellion - otherwise known as XR - this week mobilised to shut down capitals across the planet for two weeks.

The movement started early in London: last week protesters sprayed fake blood across the Treasury with a repurposed fire engine. This week, they've shut down roads around Parliament and Whitehall. Up to 400 protesters from AnimalRebellion, an off-shoot of XR, set up camp in the centre of the 800-year-old Smithfield meat market on Monday calling for the UK to transition to a vegan diet. An impromptu cricket game was held outside the Supreme Court. Activists glued themselves to the Department for Transport building and a lorry outside the Home Office, then blockaded the BBC.

A planned three-day ""peaceful occupation"" at London City Airport has created a maelstrom: yesterday, about 150 protesters encountered a huge police presence, there were 40 arrests and anyone without a valid plane ticket was turned away from the airport to prevent protesters from entering the terminal. Hundreds nonetheless joined a sit-in at the entrance to the airport's DLR station. One plane was forced to return to the terminal after taxiing down the runway, when a stowaway climate change protester disrupted the flight.

In other words, it's been a week of headline-grabbing moments. But what's it like inside the nerve centre? I cycled - obviously - into the midst of the Westminster operation, almost running over nine mute, green-robed protesters gliding past parked police vans. They raised their hands to the sky, as if gesturing at a police helicopter hovering overhead. A policeman rolls his eyes.

XR's main demand is that we achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2025. The Government's policy is to hit this target by 2050. Obviously, meeting XR's target is ambitious: repent car ownership, flights, meat eating, and everything else that adds a few shoe sizes to a personal carbon footprint. Their public reception has been, broadly, positive, though No10 has given it fairly short shrift.

Demonstrators should abandon their ""hemp-smelling bivouacs"" and stop blocking roads, said Prime Minister Boris Johnson this week, labelling the group ""uncooperative crusties"". Incidentally, the PM's father, Stanley, is an XR member and spoke in praise of protesters in Trafalgar Square on Wednesday. Police have arrested more than 1,000 people in the first four days of protests.

And granted, footage of morning yoga classes on Westminster Bridge added to an impression of a movement sheltered within a liberal bubble. It's also true that one of my new friends, a member of a group called the Green Brigade who are all dressed as postmodern druids, caresses my cheek as I ask what, specifically, they are doing. But far from a parade of ""crusties"", I find NHS workers who have taken time off work to protest, retired teachers and civil servants. A groundswell of support has seen the movement raise £40,000-aday in donations. On the mile-anda-half stretch between Lambeth Bridge and Trafalgar Square, the atmosphere is genial: a background hubbub of kazoos, cow bells and drums, with the occasional flurry of activity. One crowd occupies Abingdon Street, outside the Palace of Westminster. A procession of police officers swiftly form a line in front of them. A man followed closely on a bicycle, playing the Benny Hill theme from a set of Bluetooth speakers.

Image is everything to Extinction Rebellion. ""I dressed up smart because Boris said we were all crusties and I want to prove him wrong,"" said Charles, 49, a civil servant (he won't reveal his surname) in a suit and tie, who has taken the week off as holiday to join the protests. ""I've been interested in environmental issues for 30 years, and we've been messed about. We need system change, not individual change."" Still, there are questions about XR's demand, which many policymakers deem unrealistic, and their methods. One man in a wheelchair complains loudly that the protesters have made him late for a meeting. Two joggers in head-to-toe lululemon told me they were ""surprised"" to bump into the protest a mile into their lunchtime run. ""It's made us run faster, though"", they say.

The group has also been criticised for its single-mindedness. On Tuesday, XR made an appeal for food and blankets to be brought to their camp. Surely the needs of the homeless in Westminster are more pressing? Charles is unequivocal. ""Every other issue is irrelevant,"" he says. ""Brexit, Remain, Leave, it doesn't matter."" Homelessness? ""Doesn't matter. If we're talking catastrophic climate change then we're talking potentially billions of people dying."" (An XR spokesman admits this figure is wildly exaggerated and that ""unfortunately alarmist language works"".) OUTSIDE the Houses of Parliament, scientist Matthew Shribman, 30, and a group of co-organisers had collected a mini-forest of 1,000 UK native saplings and attached a label with an MP's name to 650 of them (the rest went to parliamentary staff and members of the public for local reforesting). MPs had been invited to collect their allotted pot; more than 400 were collected. Tory MP Zac Goldsmith, Liberal Democrat MP Sir Vince Cable, Labour MP Hilary Benn, Attorney General Geoffrey Cox and Green MP Caroline Lucas (naturally) had retrieved theirs. ""It's good for Parliament to have something that they can actually engage with,"" says Mr Shribman. ""It's amazing how warm the reception has been."" He thinks Mr Johnson's ""uncooperative crusties"" remark is unfounded. ""I've never seen so many scientists in one place"".

Volunteering as a designated ""arrestable"" is an XR tactic designed to both generate media attention and overwhelm the limited number of custody suites available to the Metropolitan Police. But the police have a duty to respond, to uphold the rule of law and keep the streets open. They were criticised for their response to XR's April protest. ""Us being here means we only have between six and 10 officers looking after Hackney,"" says one. On Monday, police cut XR protesters out of their tents using scissors in an attempt to reopen roads in central London. But many I speak to are broadly supportive.

Plenty of protesters and police chat amiably. Legal observers - former police officers and lawyers working with XR, and identified by their hi-vis jackets - work to ensure that those who want to remain within the law, and that those who wish to be arrested know their rights. Andreas, 32, a Norwegian doctor has joined the international protest. Is he conscious of his carbon footprint? ""I had to fly here,"" he admits. ""But my partner and I have promised these are the only flights we'll take this year.""

The arrests, when they do come, do so to the sound of applause. As police try to divide ebullient gatherings on Whitehall from those in Abingdon Street, several sit-down protests are staged. Police horses gather. One woman who has been boxed in by a phalanx of police, is carefully carried away by four officers. Outrage is laced with humour and violence is avoided fastidiously. ""We're rebels, so if it's a little illegal that's okay"", says Catherine, a Dane who lives in Uxbridge. ""We'll be shut down if it's really illegal, and we're wary of that. But we have to show them.""",Right-Center ,0,1295,"Druids and drums: my day as a Rebel; Closing airports, occupying Smithfield and mass arrests - and that's only week one of Extinction Rebellion's October uprising.

316,The Evening Standard ,Tabloid,2022,"RAGING OVER SPILT MILK; Whether it's activists gluing themselves to roads or upending supermarket dairy products, radical climate protests are everywhere. Tom Ellen talks to the campaigners - and police - to find out what goes into these acts… and how much it's all likely to achieve","People were shocked, and understandably so,' says Steve Bone, a 40-year-old photographer from Clacton-on-Sea, Essex. 'I mean - you walk into a shop and all of a sudden there's a tall, ginger-bearded man pouring milk all over the cheese display. You'd think: ""My God, what's going on?""' Bone, the tall, ginger-bearded man in question, is a member of Animal Rebellion, the animal and climate justice group that dominated headlines last week after several of their direct action protests went viral. You will have seen the clips: activists entering high-end food stores such as Fortnum & Mason, Selfridges and Waitrose, and proceeding to binge-dump dairy products

across the floor. To say that these antics divided opinion would be something of an understatement. Depending on where you go for your news, you'll either find passionate voices of support for Animal Rebellion's cause, or (and due to the nature of online commentary, this one's probably more likely) splenetic, expletive-filled rants about 'entitled lefties' wasting food. But more on all that noise in a moment: during the protest itself, Bone says, things felt far less hostile.

'There were a few derogatory terms thrown at us,' he tells ES Magazine of the actions he took part in at Fortnum & Mason and Selfridges. 'But we were expecting to be roughly frog-marched out, and that didn't happen [Bone and fellow protester Sofia Fernandes Pontes were arrested the next day: both appear in court on 7 November]. I go into this kind of Zen mode during these acts of civil resistance,' he adds. 'At one point, there was a gentleman stood next to me as I was pouring the milk and I was concerned he would get splashed. I was already prepared to smell like milk all day, but I didn't want him to have to as well. So I just said, ""Excuse me, sir, would you mind moving over, please?"" It was all totally non-violent.'

These episodes don't always proceed quite so peacefully. At Animal Rebellion's previous campaign in September in which

holes were drilled into delivery truck tyres at dairy production sites, Bone was 'struck in the chest' by a less-than-impressed onlooker. 'I just took it and moved away,' he says, diplomatically. 'I'm quite a calm person anyway, but when you've got people shouting at you or hitting you, you just have to keep telling yourself why you're there. You're fighting for a better future.'

It won't have escaped you that lately, the sight of people such as Bone being shouted at or hit as they fight for the future has become an almost daily occurrence. Whether it's protesters super-gluing themselves to roads, activists hurling soup cans at a Van Gogh painting or tall, ginger-bearded men redecorating the Fortnum & Mason carpet, groups including Animal Rebellion and Just Stop Oil have been consistently engaging in non-violent disruption across the UK for months. Their actions represent an attempt to draw the Government's focus to the climate crisis and, in Bone's words, 'start a national conversation'. In this, there can be no doubt that they've succeeded - you're reading this article, for a start - but there is also an unshakeable sense that perhaps the radical nature of these demonstrations is provoking less of a 'conversation' and more of a nationwide shouting match.

In typically measured fashion, Piers Morgan branded Animal Rebellion's milk-pourers 'pathetic, attention-seeking morons' on Twitter. Just prior to her resignation, the UK's shortest-serving home secretary, Suella Braverman, placed the blame for the disruption squarely on 'The Guardianreading, tofu-eating wokerati' (didn't they do a John Peel session in 1986?). These are extreme examples, of course. But no matter where you stand on the political spectrum, you will undoubtedly have come across people (online or off) who share the protesters' concerns but are sceptical about their methods of expression. Were there any worries on Animal Rebellion's part about throwing away food during a cost-of-living crisis?

'That's why we didn't target supermarkets or department stores where people who are

struggling to buy milk are shopping,' Bone explains. 'Frankly, if you can afford to buy milk in Fortnum & Mason, you're not struggling with the cost of living. Outside of that', he adds, '[dairy] milk isn't made for us, it's made for baby cows. If you want to get technical about it, the milk has been ""wasted"" as soon as it's taken from the calf.'

Animal Rebellion's proposed solution to this wastage is for the Government to support farmers to transition away from animal farming to a plant-based food system. 'That would free up so much land, which can thenbe rewilded, bringing down greenhouse gases and bringing back our beautiful British countryside,' says Bone. 'I've got a six-year-old girl - I don't want her growing up in a country that's brown and barren.'

Bone came to activism late, turning vegan four years ago after watching Netflix documentary The Game Changers, which explores the strength benefits of plant-based eating. But it was only this year that he felt compelled to put himself in the line of fire (or at least, fists) for the sake of the climate: 'It was just having conversations with people, and their refusal to see how evil animal farming is, not just its cruelty to the animals but also what it's doing to our planet. We're talking about the sixth mass extinction, up to three billion climate refugees expected by 2050, according to the United Nations. It was causing my wife and me real anxiety and stress, and we thought: ""We can't just stand by; we need to take action.""' Anxiety and stress are the emotions powering most of these climate protest groups. Emma Brown, 31, is a member of Just Stop Oil, the movement responsible for that Van Gogh soup-throwing incident at the National Gallery. 'I can't sleep the night before [protests]. I feel sick with nerves,' she says. 'It might look like what we're doing is easy, but as human beings it's very uncomfortable to behave in a socially unacceptable way. It's like if you just started singing in the middle of the street - people would look at you like you were mad. When doing [these actions], we're putting ourselves up

for a lot of hatred, vitriol and ridicule.'

You don't have to look far for evidence of

this: social media is currently chock-ablock with clips of irate motorists screaming at road-blocking protesters. Critics of the groups would point to this 'hatred, vitriol and ridicule' as an indication that their tactics aren't working: how is disrupting the lives of regular people going to win Animal Rebellion or Just Stop Oil new followers?

'This idea that we're turning people against our cause... It's not our cause, it's everyone's', Brown says. 'That's why comments like Andrew Marr's, saying, ""Right, they've absolutely lost me, forever"" [Marr's tweet in response to Just Stop Oil's soup stunt] are ridiculous. Whether or not you agree with our tactics, we are all affected by this. None of us wants to starve or die in a

climate-related disaster. If what we do seems radical, it's because we need radical change.'

A radical approach is also needed, protesters say, because other methods have failed. Last November's UN Climate Change Conference (COP26) in Glasgow saw a focus on education as a vital component in tackling the climate crisis. Brown was at protests surrounding the summit, which she feels has made, 'excuse my French, but f***-all difference. The Government is still licensing new fossil fuel projects and the huge social and political change we need is not going to happen by having a few more education stalls. But disruption to businesses and supermarkets immediately gets heard and talked about by politicians and it moves [the climate crisis] to the top of the agenda. It's our last, best hope.'

Commander Karen Findlay, the Met police chief responsible for major events and public order, would argue otherwise.

She is keen to stress the strain the recent swathe of protests has put on police resources in the capital. 'It's really tough,' she tells us. 'We're at more than 6,500 officer shifts [on these protests] now, and a total of 506 arrests [as of 20 October]. This means that on a daily basis, officers are being taken away from front-line policing duties such as reducing knife crime or properly investigating sexual offences.'

Findlay also highlights specific tactics that protest groups employ, which, intentionally or otherwise, require a larger police presence or specialised training. 'You'll have seen clips of protesters going limp, meaning it takes four officers to remove them, rather than just one,' she says. 'Also, if protesters have glued themselves to roads, we need to bring in specialists who are trained in de-bonding. What we can't do is what some [police officers] have been reported as

doing in France, which is simply rip the protesters' hands offthe road. That's not acceptable - we have a duty of care towards the protesters as well as the public.'

For her part, Brown maintains that the police officers she has encountered during actions have been largely sympathetic to the Just Stop Oil cause. 'That might change as they feel more and more stretched,' she admits. 'But at one protest I had a policeman tell me how hard it was with his baby during the heatwave. He was really worried

about the climate, and kept asking us, ""What can I do to help?""' For Findlay, however, the police are in place to respond practically to these protests rather than emotionally: 'We understand that people are really concerned about the climate and we will always facilitate protests. But it's not our job to place judgement on the virtue of the cause; it's our job to be consistent and impartial in our response to it. For me, there's enough pressure on society right now already. You can see why people become frustrated if they can't get to work or get their kids to school. When those things become disrupted, that doesn't seem appropriate to me.'

Appropriate or not, the protesters remain adamant that their actions are getting results, and not only in raising the blood pressure of Daily Mail readers. Brown cites a YouGov poll, taken after a blockade she was involved in outside an oil terminal, that showed 'a small increase' in people willing to take direct action on the climate. Bone, too, talks of the lengthy historical success rate that non-violent civil disobedience has enjoyed ('Gandhi, the Civil Rights Movement, gay liberation marches...') He also speaks of the positive reaction Animal Rebellion has received when engaging with dairy farmers about the group's demands. 'Most farmers [we've spoken to] are fully with us,' he says. 'They know they're trapped between a rock and a hard place in this [dairy industry] system.' It should be pointed out, though, that when ES Magazine contacted the National

Farmers' Union for comment, NFU dairy board chair Michael Oakes replied: 'During a cost-of-living crisis... farmers have been shocked about these reckless plans to block supply chains, cause disruption and purposely waste food.'

Clearly, then, consensus on these demonstrations is still a long way off, so don't expect the protests to stop any time soon. Animal Rebellion is planning various outreach events in the run-up to its next campaign in spring next year, while Just Stop Oil is clambering up new bridges and blocking new roads every day. 'It's like there's a brick wall in front of us,' Brown says towards the end of our conversation. 'And that brick wall is the system that's killing us by being so inflexible to change. People have been throwing stones at this wall for years and now we're doing it, too, with these protests. Day after day after day we're trying to weaken the wall. That's why we continue… because you never know which stone will be the one to break through.'

318,The Evening Standard ,Tabloid,2022,Police officer injured as Just Stop Oil protest leads to lorry crash on M25; Police officer 'swerved to avoid protester which led to lorry crash',"A POLICE officer was injured today as a Just Stop Oil protest led to a lorry crash on the M25 during another day of widespread disruption on the motorway.

Essex Police said the officer was hurt in a ""collision involving two lorries and a police motorbike"" after a ""rolling roadblock"" had been set up

to deal with a protester who had gone onto the motorway.

A witness said the accident, between junctions 26 and 27, happened when the officer's motorbike swerved to try to intercept a female protester climbing a pole.

Images of the scene showed two large lorries Continued on Page 7

side by side with their cabs crashed

together. The police motorbike was nearby lying on the hard shoulder.

Essex Police said the officer had

escaped serious injury but Chief Superintendent Simon Anslow said his thoughts remained ""with them and

their family"" in a sign of the potential severity of the accident.

A witness told MailOnline that they had been ""driving along at around 6.21am when a woman started climbing a concrete pole"".

""A police officer on a motorbike swerved to try to stop her and collided with a lorry, which then crashed into another lorry. They arrested the woman before she could get on to the gantry.""

The road was closed and two protesters arrested for causing a public nuisuance. The accident came as Just Stop Oil protesters climbing gantries elsewhere on the motorway caused a series of other road closures and accompanying delays for drivers in the third day of disruption this week.

The closures included in the clockwise direction between junctions 4 and 5, 7 and 8, and between 23 and 27, while there were anti-clockwise shutdowns between junctions 8 and 9, 13 and 14, and 22 to 23. The motorway was also closed in both directions between junctions 29 and 30.

Police announced the arrest of several protesters after their removal from gantries although there were no immediate details of the total number of those either detained or involved in today's protests. The main focus, how-

ever, was on the accident involving the police officer.

It follows days of warnings by police and others about the danger being caused to motorists and others by the Just Stop Oil protests and will intensify pressure for tougher act ion to stop future disruption and punish those responsible.

Giving details of the accident, Essex Police said that officers had initially

""intervened to deal with someone on the motorway between junction 26 and 27"" and that ""a rolling roadblock was put in place"" before a collision occurred ""involving two lorries and a police motorbike"".

Chief Superintendent Anslow added: ""Officers have again responded quickly to minimise disruption and two persons have already been arrested. One of our officers has been injured as they worked to help resolve this situation. My

thoughts are with them and their family.""

In a statement, Just Stop Oil described the accident as ""awful"" but again insisted that its action was necessary to change policy on fossil fuels.

Activists from Animal Rebellion, a group campaigning for ""a plant-based food system"", also joined today's M25 protests.

COST OF LIVING HITS PLANS TO GO GREEN

LONDONERS are becoming increasingly worried about climate change but say the cost-of-living crisis is blighting efforts to live a ""greener"" lifestyle.

Three-quarters of the 1,010 respondents to a London Councils survey said they are struggling to afford to switch to more environmental energy supplies or install energy-efficient heaters or solar panels.

Some 72 per cent said their concerns about climate change had grown in the last 12 months, with more than half prepared to cut their ""carbon footprint"" if it meant cheaper bills. Almost a third of Londoners are prepared to consider buying an electric or hybrid car - with almost one in 10 having done so already. A quarter were having a staycation rather than flying abroad.",Right-Center ,0,647,"Police officer injured as Just Stop Oil protest leads to lorry crash on M25; Police officer 'swerved to avoid protester which led to lorry crash'A POLICE officer was injured today as a Just Stop Oil protest led to a lorry crash on the M25 during another day of widespread disruption on the motorway.

Essex Police said the officer was hurt in a ""collision involving two lorries and a police motorbike"" after a ""rolling roadblock"" had been set up

to deal with a protester who had gone onto the motorway.

A witness said the accident, between junctions 26 and 27, happened when the officer's motorbike swerved to try to intercept a female protester climbing a pole.

side by side with their cabs crashed

together. The police motorbike was nearby lying on the hard shoulder.

Essex Police said the officer had

escaped serious injury but Chief Superintendent Simon Anslow said his thoughts remained ""with them and

their family"" in a sign of the potential severity of the accident.

A witness told MailOnline that they had been ""driving along at around 6.21am when a woman started climbing a concrete pole"".

""A police officer on a motorbike swerved to try to stop her and collided with a lorry, which then crashed into another lorry. They arrested the woman before she could get on to the gantry.""

The road was closed and two protesters arrested for causing a public nuisuance. The accident came as Just Stop Oil protesters climbing gantries elsewhere on the motorway caused a series of other road closures and accompanying delays for drivers in the third day of disruption this week.

The closures included in the clockwise direction between junctions 4 and 5, 7 and 8, and between 23 and 27, while there were anti-clockwise shutdowns between junctions 8 and 9, 13 and 14, and 22 to 23. The motorway was also closed in both directions between junctions 29 and 30.

Police announced the arrest of several protesters after their removal from gantries although there were no immediate details of the total number of those either detained or involved in today's protests. The main focus, how-

ever, was on the accident involving the police officer.

It follows days of warnings by police and others about the danger being caused to motorists and others by the Just Stop Oil protests and will intensify pressure for tougher act ion to stop future disruption and punish those responsible.

Giving details of the accident, Essex Police said that officers had initially

""intervened to deal with someone on the motorway between junction 26 and 27"" and that ""a rolling roadblock was put in place"" before a collision occurred ""involving two lorries and a police motorbike"".

Chief Superintendent Anslow added: ""Officers have again responded quickly to minimise disruption and two persons have already been arrested. One of our officers has been injured as they worked to help resolve this situation. My

thoughts are with them and their family.""

In a statement, Just Stop Oil described the accident as ""awful"" but again insisted that its action was necessary to change policy on fossil fuels.

Activists from Animal Rebellion, a group campaigning for ""a plant-based food system"", also joined today's M25 protests.

Animal Rebellion claims the pandemic can be linked back to humans exploiting other creatures.

It is calling on the Government to end to animal farming and says the coronavirus pandemic 'could have been prevented'.

The activists have also claimed research suggests 'three out of every four new infectious diseases originate from animals'.

The stunt saw both of the fountains at the London landmark turned red.

Footage shows red-handed activists pouring dye into the fountains and holding up placards which claim the Government has ""blood on its hands"".

A small group of campaigners are also seen socially distanced from each other near the water features listening to speeches.

Two people have been arrested as a result of the protest.

Cops were seen telling activists to come out of the fountain.

Some scientists believe Covid-19 could have come from bats, and that humans coming into contact with wild animals could be a cause.

Animal Rebellion also believes many diseases are spread by humans coming into close contact with wild animals.

It also believes swine flu can is linked to farming practices and that plant-based diets are more sustainable and environmentally friendly.

Stephanie Zupan, a spokesperson for Animal Rebellion, said: ""The warnings from Covid-19 could not be starker.

""The government must now begin a transition towards a plant-based food system, or risk future zoonotic pandemics of catastrophic proportions.""

","Animal rights protesters have blocked four McDonald's distribution centres in the UK - sparking fears of a mass shortage of food for 1,300 restaurants.

The action is being taken by Animal Rebellion which has about 50 protesters at distribution sites in Hemel Hempstead, Basingstoke, Coventry, and Heywood, Greater Manchester.

It is understood that the group plan to prevent lorries and distribution vehicles from leaving the centres and stopping supplies from reaching the fast food restaurants around the UK.

Animal Rebellion has said the group plan to remain at the sites for at least 24 hours, causing ""significant disruption"" to the McDonald's supply chain.

A group called Extinction Rebellion Muslim are also understood to be at one of the distribution centres.

In a Tweet , it said: ""We must reflect on what we eat, how & where we make it, who makes it, who profits from it, what could be made that is better for our health & the planet, all while protecting jobs on the ground.""

The group is demanding McDonald's commit to becoming fully plant-based by 2025.

James Ozden, a spokesman for the group, said the action is aimed at calling out the animal agriculture industry for their part in the global climate crisis.

He said: ""The meat and dairy industry is destroying our planet: causing huge amounts of rainforest deforestation, emitting immense quantities of greenhouse gases and killing billions of animals each year.

","A group of animal activists have vowed to leave supermarket shelves empty of milk for a fortnight as they campaign to call time on the dairy industry.

Animal Rebellion has announced that it will be “mobilising 500 people to shut down the supply of dairy to the UK” as it bids to cause “large-scale material disruption” to the milk supply.

The group’s co-founder Dan Kidby added: “What this will mean in practice is for a one to two-week period there will be no milk on the supermarket shelves. This has never been done before in the UK or around the world.”

If Animal Rebellion follows through on their threat, it will only add to the chaos already being caused by fuel protesters and Extinction Rebellion campaigners, as well as rail strikes and the massive queues holidaymakers are facing on their way to France – not to mention the soaring cost of energy.

The group have outlined their demands in a video announcing their plans.

They want to move people who currently work in the “destructive” meat, dairy and fishing industries to plant-based industries instead. And they want the land that would be freed up by such a move to be devoted to rewilding.

“Decades of climate research has shown that we are running out of time to secure a liveable future for everyone,” said Animal Rebellion spokesperson Emma de Saram, 21.

“We are calling on our government to urgently begin a transition to a plant-based food system where we would use significantly fewer natural resources, less energy and less land.

The group’s co-founder Dan Kidby added: “What this will mean in practice is for a one to two-week period there will be no milk on the supermarket shelves. This has never been done before in the UK or around the world.”

If Animal Rebellion follows through on their threat, it will only add to the chaos already being caused by fuel protesters and Extinction Rebellion campaigners, as well as rail strikes and the massive queues holidaymakers are facing on their way to France – not to mention the soaring cost of energy.

The group have outlined their demands in a video announcing their plans.

They want to move people who currently work in the “destructive” meat, dairy and fishing industries to plant-based industries instead. And they want the land that would be freed up by such a move to be devoted to rewilding.

“Decades of climate research has shown that we are running out of time to secure a liveable future for everyone,” said Animal Rebellion spokesperson Emma de Saram, 21.

“We are calling on our government to urgently begin a transition to a plant-based food system where we would use significantly fewer natural resources, less energy and less land.

“Rewilding spaces previously misused for animal farming and fishing would have the dual benefit of drawing-down carbon from the atmosphere and restoring precious biodiversity.

“We are hoping that people will hear our message and support us in sustained action to stop the supply of dairy this September.”"
326,Daily Star,Tabloid,2022,Vegan militia' activist group to stage anti-milk protests to send prices soaring,"Vegan militia' activist group Animal Rebellion has vowed to stage anti-milk protests to send prices soaring during cost of living crisis.

Britain's milk deliveries could be under siege from the group of vegan campaigners -an offshoot of Extinction Rebellion -who are threatening to disrupt supplies.

Up to 500 activists could take part in plans to block dairy depots over two weeks while demanding a switch to plant-based alternatives.


The protest group has vowed to carry out the protest in an effort to promote its vegan agenda, warning: ""People are prepared to do whatever it non-violently takes — and that includes prison.""

Yesterday, a director of one of the country's biggest milk suppliers warned there could be shortages if the campaign group stages its protest, The Sun reports.

Ash Amirahmadi of Arla Foods UK said: ""Anything that adds to the cost of business will end up adding to costs for customers.

""We are working with police and government to make sure it keeps being supplied.""

The average price of a pint of milk has jumped to 59p amid the cost of living crisis.

Last month, activists from Animal Rebelllion poured out milk over the floor of Harrods department store in Knightsbridge and were forcibly removed by security.

Vegans on social media later condemned the group's actions, saying they ""made us look like fools"" and it was ""detrimental rather than helpful"".

Twitter users were also quick to point out that the protestors -who also staged sit ins at other supermarkets and cleared shelves of milk and dairy products -were only making ""a mess for the cleaners to clean up' and making it 'dangerous for disabled customers'.

One twitter user said: ""You didn't hurt the dairy industry here, you gave them a large new order.""

American actor Travis Wester was also involved in the online backlash, telling Animal Rebellion, ""the next time you want to virtue signal with perfectly good food, I suggest you use it to feed the hungry"".

In the video of the protest, which took place on July 27, the group are seen walking up to the milk section of the Food Hall in Harrods before pouring the milk out of the cartons onto the floor one-by-one.

Members of the group resist security removing them, with a number of people needed to physically remove the activists from the store.

A woman in the background can be heard saying ""why are you doing this It's disgusting"".

Animal Rebellion also occupied 'The Cheese Room' at a Waitrose store and other dairy aisles in London and Bristol.

Beau King Houston, one of the protestors at Harrods, said: ""We took this action in Harrods to show that we won't stand by as unsustainable, destructive industries wreak havoc on lives across the globe.

""Harrods is a symbol of the broken system we are living in.

From pointing out the obscenity of the waste in a cost-of-living crisis to underlining the fact that a low-paid worker would have to clean up the mess, the direct action was widely lambasted as the worst sort of privileged, self-indulgent, performative protest.

It’s one thing to protest outside a supermarket or cheese shop and directly lobby shoppers about what goes on inside the dairy industry but stunts like the one in Harrods smack of the sort of desperate desire for attention that you see every day on social media platforms like TikTok.

It may go down well with those already converted but for the mass of the tea-loving population who don’t think beyond a lot or a little when it comes to milk, it simply alienates and irritates. And that is what Beau and his urban cookie collective are missing.

The street demonstrations of the past were specifically designed to attract people to the cause. With clearly articulated aims that seemed to make sense to most people, the aim was to create a consensus in society that politicians couldn’t ignore.

Lou Hadden, a charity worker from Herefordshire who joined the action at Fortnum and Mason, said: “This is not how I imagined spending my weekend.

“Unfortunately, this disruption is necessary to get those in power to listen to the academics at Oxford, Harvard and the IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change).

“The world’s best climate and land scientists are calling for the transition to a plant-based food system.

“We need bold and decisive politics at this time, not the horror show we currently see.”

Meanwhile, Skylar Sharples, an international development graduate from Bristol and one of the protesters at Harrods, said: “Supporters of Animal Rebellion are back acting because (Prime Minister) Liz Truss and Ranil Jayawardena (Environment Secretary) are again deciding to ignore calls to start building a better future.

“A plant-based future would see a beautiful world for us all, thriving with nature and life.

“The steps to properly support farmers in this transition need to begin now.”"
335,The Scotsman,Tabloid,2022,"Animal Rebellion activists slammed over ‘milk pour’ protests in supermarkets including Harrods, Waitrose & M&S","Animal Rebellion protestors have earned the wrath of the public after pouring milk onto the floor in high-end shops across the country on Saturday (October 15) amid ongoing cost of living crisis that plunged many into poverty in their attempt to create a ‘plant-based future’.

The animal activists coordinated the action in five supermarket locations in London that include Waitrose, Whole Foods, Harrods, and Marks and Spencer along with other stores in Manchester, Norwich and Edinburgh just before 12pm.

The action, which was filmed and has now gone viral on social media, shows several protesters pouring milk from the shelves in the Norwich Marks and Spencer in front of horrified shoppers. Norwich Police confirmed that four people had been arrested for offences of assault and criminal damage.

In Knightbridge, one group of protestors poured milk into Harrods’ food hall, while another was seen pouring milk bottles onto the floor and onto a cheese-laden table in Piccadilly’s Fortnum and Mason. The activists said that they are advocating for a plant-based future and stressing the importance of assisting farmers in transitioning to a sustainable plant-based food system.

‘They should have to pay for it’
One of their videos, which was posted on their Twitter page, has so far received 12.3 million views with many calling out the activists for the ‘massive wastage’ where it could have gone to those in need. Some even said they should ‘pay for it’. One said: “Acting as if there isn’t a cost of living crisis going on and families are struggling to get by whilst they pour milk all over the floor. They should have to pay for it.”

Another said: “I’ve been vegan for eight years now and mortified by this. Waitrose will now have to order yet more dairy milk to replace it. So that’s more harm done. And as a shop worker, I would be one of the people who had to come and clean this up. #NotInMyName.”

A man commented that their action would not get people to support their cause. He said: “While food banks proliferate and people are plunged into poverty, this is the best you can do? You’d get people on your side by donating plant-based meals to people in real need.” One said: “If anything, this sets the vegan cause back years.”

One man however said he understood the drastic action taken by the group. He said: “I think their point is that there’d be far fewer people without food if land wasn’t all being used to provide food and dairy in the western world. The amount of land required for livestock is insane, causing deforestation and starvation.”

‘We don’t have a choice’
In an interview later with LBC, Animal Rebellion spokesperson Robert Gordon said: ""Right wing commentators would have you believe we picked these supermarkets because it’s all we know, because it’s where mummy and daddy took us as kids.

""In reality, we’re just a group of really concerned individuals who have carefully picked these high-end shops because we acknowledge that when we take action. There’s an inevitable level of disruption that will be caused - and we really didn’t want to be disrupting those who are suffering most in the cost of living crisis.

""We picked the Fortnum & Masons, the Selfridges, the M&Ss and we’re sorry for those people who did get caught in that disruption…Frankly, at this point, we don’t have a choice.""

In a statement, another spokesperson for the group, Nathan McGovern said: “We understand that the actions have divided opinion, and fully shoulder the responsbility for them.

“Yet, they have resulted in a massive, critical, discussion about the importance of transitioning to a plant-based food system and following the advice coming out of Oxford and Harvard Universities. We urgently need our government to step up and act on the climate and cost-of-living crisis, until then individuals will be stepping up into peaceful civil resistance.”",Left-center Bias,1,652,"Animal Rebellion activists slammed over ‘milk pour’ protests in supermarkets including Harrods, Waitrose & M&SAnimal Rebellion protestors have earned the wrath of the public after pouring milk onto the floor in high-end shops across the country on Saturday (October 15) amid ongoing cost of living crisis that plunged many into poverty in their attempt to create a ‘plant-based future’.

336,The Scotsman,Tabloid,2022,"The milk protests are the height of privileged entitlement - Stephen Jardine
","The direct action involves protestors straight out of central casting opening milk cartons and pouring the contents all over the floor while intoning some half-remembered and even less understood word spaghetti about the need for a ‘plant based future’. The action is intended to try to persuade society to move away from dairy and into plant-based agriculture. However the farmers have already been paid for the milk now swilling around the supermarket floor and they will be paid even more to replace the lost stock.

Straight away, we have a problem. Lets hope the youngsters involved are not studying economics because thinking that increasing demand will cut supply is unlikely to get themthrough to graduation.

After capturing the necessary footage for social media the protestors leave the store and post their self-righteous indignation on social media while and a minimum wage worker has to clear up the mess.

However, the reaction has not been what they intended. If the Just Stop Oil protestors have divided public opinion then Animal Rebellion has united it in anger and incomprehension.

“Every time you do this I will buy an extra pint of milk”, was a common response. Vegans also weighed in pointing out the tactics were at best poorly thought out and quite possibly moronic. “You just turn people against us” posted someone who had followed a plant-based diet for more than 30 years.

Part of the problem is that this performative self indulgence takes place against the background of a cost of living crisis where some families have to rely on a foodbank for milk.

The sight of people who’ve never had to think about where their next pint is coming from actually wasting food is particularly hard to stomach right now.

The right to protest is a key part of our democracy. So they could leaflet shoppers coming into the store or meet dairy farmers and voice their objections to the industry or sit down with the supermarkets and lobby them for change.

However that is a bit boring and doesn’t translate will into the kind of high jinks that Tik Tok loves. Hence some poor soul has to get out a bucket and mop just so some attention seeking virtue signallers can get their likes.

The milk pour protests may be the epitome of performative protest but they change absolutely nothing.

If you’ve ever taken part in a march or demonstration you will know the power that comes from the mass of people. Passers by may take a leaflet and think more carefully about a cause that has brought so many individuals together. Every person who makes the switch to veganism has been won over by information and arguments, not by some privileged wastrel making a mess in a supermarket.

","Gordon Ramsay’s three-star Michelin restaurant in London’s Chelsea was occupied by climate crisis activists on Saturday evening who descended to protest at the “perfect inequality” of high-end dining venues. A group of Animal Rebellion supporters entered Restaurant Gordon Ramsay on Royal Hospital Road at around 6pm where they could be seen holding “mock menus” outling the environmental and social cost of the food served in the restaurant.

The mock menus also contained the group’s core demands for a “plant-based future” stylised as a starter, main and dessert. The restaurant serves dinners starting at a price of £155 per person, with dishes including veal and steak which are among the foods with the largest carbon and land-use footprints.

Lucia Alexander, a 39-year-old auxiliary nurse, was involved in the demonstration. In a statement, she called for the UK to transition to a plant-based food system which the group claims is “the answer” to the cost of living and climate crises.

“This restaurant is the perfect example of the inequality we face in the UK right now,” said Ms Alexander. “While Gordon Ramsay serves food costing a minimum of £155 per person, more than two million people are relying on food banks in this cost-of-living crisis.

“Instead of restaurants making colossal profits at the expense of animals, workers, and our climate, we need to feed everyone by supporting farmers and fishing communities in a transition to a plant-based food system. A plant-based food system requires 75% less farmland to grow food, allowing us to feed millions of additional people without the reliance on exploitative and inefficient animal farming industries.”

The group said 14 activists took part in the protest. They added: “At 8pm the restaurant closed for businesses and the protesters left peacefully through the front door.”

The Metropolitan police said officers were called to the restaurant “to reports of a group of protesters refusing to leave the premises”. A spokesperson said: “The restaurant was closed and the protesters left. There were no arrests.”

Animal Rebellion said they intend to remain at the sites for at least 24 hours, causing ""significant disruption"" to the McDonald's supply chain.

In a segment asking ""are animal activists hypocrites"", radio presenter Cristo Foufas criticised the protest.

However, Animal Rebellion co-founder Dan Kidby told GMB host Charlotte Hawkins that he ""completely stands by"" the action.

","Animals rights activists attempted to take over a Michelin Star eatery -but sat in the bar instead of disrupting the restaurant.

Nine members of Animal Rebellion entered House of Tides on the Newcastle at around 6pm on Saturday evening. The fine dining restaurant, located on the Quayside, is run by chef Kenny Atkinson.

The group entered the venue when it opened at 6pm and aimed to occupy tables reserved for diners. However they sat in the bar downstairs instead of the restaurant, which is located upstairs.

Everything you need to know about Animal Rebellion and House of Tides after Sit-In protest

The protesters sat at tables with mock menus outlining the group's demands. The menus said: ""This menu would spare the lives of 1.2 billion land animals and more than three million sea animals in the UK every year.

""This menu would eliminate 70% of food-related emissions and draw down 150 gigatons of carbon from the atmosphere. This menu would provide more than enough affordable, nutritious plant-based food to feed everyone.""

Conor Goulding, manager at House of Tides, told Chronicle Live that the protest did not impact service in their restaurant. He said it was ""mildly inconvenient"" that they had to call the police but that it had no affect on them at all.

He said: ""They obviously thought they wee causing a massive inconvenience. They didn't realise that our restaurant was upstairs. We haven't been affected at all by it. They sat in our bar area for about 45 minutes.

""We decided to ring the police because they wouldn't leave. None of them got arrested. They left before they got that point.""

Mr Goulding said that nothing like that has ever happened before at House of Tides but they expect little things like this to happen when the restaurant has a name and a reputation.

He said: ""I think with all of this extreme protests there's a conversation to be had but by targeting very small businesses such as ourselves -an independent business -is the wrong way to go about it.

""They should be targeting huge companies like KFC and McDonalds which are using large farms. We use small local producers who take very good care of their animals. Our restaurant serves between 30 and 40 people.""

According to Animal Rebellion, House of Tides serves dinners starting at a price of £130 per person. They claim that the venue refuses to cater to vegans and has a meat-heavy menu, including many of the foods with the largest carbon, and land-use, footprints, such as lamb.

Mr Goulding said the restaurant offers a vegetarian menu but they don't cater for vegans as they use a lot of classic French cooking. He added: ""We use lots of butter and cream in our dishes.""

The actions come as part of Animal Rebellion's demands for a plant-based future. The group is planning multiple high-end Sit-Ins on Saturday evening as they declare a national day of action.

A spokesperson for Animal Rebellion said: ""The conversation around the climate, animal, and cost-of-living crises is exactly why this action has been a success, alongside the other sit ins. It's forced everyone to have this critical dialogue.""

What is the Sit-In campaign

A Sit-In is involves occupying tables reserved for customers and holding 'mock menus' outlining the group's core demands stylised as a starter, main, and dessert.

These actions come as part of Animal Rebellion's demands for a plant-based future, which were announced on May 23.

The animal and climate justice group is urging wholesale governmental and societal support for farmers and fishing communities to transition to a plant-based food system and programme of rewilding that will secure a future for generations to come.

The group is planning multiple high-end Sit-Ins on Saturday evening as they declare a national day of action.

They said the actions will continue until the government takes meaningful action to address the climate and ecological emergencies, and eliminate animal suffering.

""This menu would provide more than enough affordable, nutritious plant-based food to food everyone.""

The restaurant is understood to have rang the police. Protesters remained at the venue for around 45 minutes before they were moved on. Pictures show officers inside the restaurant talking to protesters.

A spokesperson for Animal Rebellion said: ""They entered the restaurant around quarter to six. There was nine people. They went in and explained to the host that it was a protest. They occupied the tables preventing people in the restaurant from being able to be seated. The restaurant rang the police.""

Mirror Online reports how the protest was carried out during a day of action. The sit-in is the first of several expected tonight with protesters set to occupy other restaurants in London and Birmingham.

According to the group, House of Tides was targeted as it does not cater to vegans.

Protester Robert Gordon, 26, a former animal care assistant, said: ""This action is the first of multiple high-end restaurant sit-ins that will be happening across England this evening. We are targeting these venues in sustained action as they are symbolic of a broken system.

""Households in the North-East have the lowest disposable income when compared to other regions in the UK. Yet House of Tides continues to profit off a wealthy minority by serving meat, dairy, and fish at the expense of our natural world.

""Instead, luxury restaurants like these should be leading by example and transitioning to serving sustainable, plant-based foods.

""A plant-based food system could eliminate the suffering of the one billion farmed animals, and many more fish, killed in the UK each year.

""This would also free-up space for crucial rewilding to draw-down carbon from the atmosphere and restore our countryside, coasts, and precious wildlife.""

The action comes a month after members shut down Gordon Ramsay's three star Michelin restaurant in Chelsea, west London, when they sat at reserved tables in smart casual clothing. They held mock menus outlining the environmental costs of items served on the restaurant's menu, including steak and veal.

The bronze artwork in Pollok Country Park in Glasgow recognises the work done by the force's dogs to help catch criminals, find missing people and sniff out drugs, explosives and firearms.

Modelled on one of Police Scotland's best dogs, the £35,000 statue was crafted by sculptor John Doubleday.

Dog handler PC Carrie-Ann McNab, who spent two-anda-half years campaigning for the statue and fundraising, is thrilled by the result.

Carrie said: ""It really is a dream come true to see the statue finally unveiled and standing there in all its glory. It's just beautiful. I can't thank everyone enough for donating and raising money for such a great cause.

""Every day in Scotland a police dog helps their local community finding missing people, criminals, recovering property or sniffing out drugs, cash, firearms or explosives.

""Their acts of heroism are countless, as is the number of lives they have helped their human partners save, so it is brilliant to have somewhere handlers and the public can come to remember them.

""There is one other similar memorial in Essex but that was a long way for Scottish handlers to go to pay tribute to dogs they had lost, so having a statue here will make all the difference not only for police officers but as a way of drawing attention to the work these dogs do.""

The statue, situated near Police Scotland's Dog Unit and Training Centre, is of Ziggy, who died two years ago.

Carrie, who works with German shepherd Bodie and drug-sniffing cocker spaniel Billy, said: ""The statue depicts PD Ziggy, a Belgian Malinois, who sadly passed away before the statue was finished.

""He epitomised what a police dog should be - physically imposing, confident, courageous and with a passion to work. There is not a single dog on the force that has not carried out countless acts of bravery.

""We owe so much to these fearless four-legged heroes and I'm delighted we now have a lasting tribute to them in Scotland.""

It was unveiled on Friday by retired Dog Sergeant Cammy Shanks during a ceremony attended by Chief Superintendent Helen Harrison and Police Scotland Chaplain Reverend Neil Galbraith.

It was a particularly poignant moment for Cammy, 62, who has terminal cancer and feared he would not live to see the memorial unveiling.

Cammy, who was a dog handler for 20 years, said: ""It's an honour and privilege to still be here to unveil such a special tribute.

""Scotland's police dogs deserve to have their own memorial. They are a key part of the force and their bravery deserves to be recognised.""

Stephanie Zupan, of Animal Rebellion, said: ""The Government must begin a transition towards a plantbased food system or risk future zoonotic pandemics of catastrophic proportions.""

Animal Rebellion said the action was coordinated with protests in 20 cities, including Bristol, Brighton and New York.

Disturbance at rail station Three people were arrested after a disturbance when police asked a large group gathered at a train station to disperse.

Officers were called to Queens Park Station in Glasgow at about 2.50pm yesterday following reports of a large gathering there. Police said three males aged 15, 28 and 35 were arrested in connection with a ""subsequent disturbance"".

The sculpture was a labour of love for Doubleday, who is known for his statues of Nelson Mandela and his Beatles tribute in Liverpool.

That was my mantra. Corden has since apologised for his behaviour (although we're still waiting on an apology for his 2009 film Lesbian Vampire Killers) so, as a firm believer in giving someone a second chance, I'll reverse my decision to stop watching his US chat show.

I tune in EVERY night, dear reader, mainly in the hope he's booked Stevie Wonder for the Carpool Karaoke slot… Staying with food, I see burger chain McDonald's is about to axe one of its most popular products - the Chicken Legend. (My missus is gutted.)

352,Daily Record,Tabloid,2022,"Must I paint you a picture? Throwing soup at art won't change the world

","People are entitled to peacefully protest.

It's a fundamental right to gather and express our views but I cannot support the appalling act of throwing soup over Vincent van Gogh's Sunflowers at The National Gallery in London.

The priceless painting might be protected by glass but who in their right mind thinks doing such a thing is the appropriate way to bring attention to the Just Stop Oil cause or, indeed, ANY cause.

We all know the cost-of-living crisis is part of the cost-of-oil crisis but what does that have to do with a tin of soup?

Sit-ins and stopping traffic are effective (and annoying) yet they're sometimes a necessary evil. But there's something utterly reckless and despicable about potentially destroying one of the most recognisable paintings in the world.

I help a lot stuff 'likes'

For me, protesting is about getting people to think about the cause and trying to make them engage with the issue on a level that's non-threatening, effective and accessible.

Every year I attend Pride to celebrate equal rights for the LGBTQ+ community. It's fun and fabulous but there's a very important message behind it, as it originated from the Stonewall riots in the late

Sixties when LGBTQ+ people stood up against police harassment. These days Pride has become a worldwide movement that's largely supported and a good example of how to make people stop and listen, to recognise the mistakes of the past but move forward in a positive way.

n't of this done for and hits

I understand not every protest can be lighthearted and enjoyable. I also marched against the Iraq War and more recently marked the Black Lives Matter movement in Scotland. The gathering was scheduled during lockdown so I decided to join the protest from my garden.

It was a time when I had to weigh up the safety of myself and others against my dedication to the cause and doing the right thing. This is where Just Stop Oil is going wrong. The issue is massively important, urgent and present, yet the actions seem misjudged and infantile, which is turning swathes of people against them.

Similarly, Animal Rebellion protesters pouring milk onto a shop floor is churlish and wasteful. I'm not thinking about the dairy industry and greenhouse gases. I'm angry for the worker who'll have to clean up the mess.

It may be wrong of me but I have to assume that many of the Just Stop Oil and Animal Rebellion members enjoy a certain level of privilege that allows them to so confidently commit these acts without fear of punishment like ending up in a cell or gaining a criminal record. As a working-class woman of colour, at 20 years old I wouldn't have dared to risk being in trouble with the law and jeopardising my future in that way - I would have been terrified of the consequences.

A climate change protester vandalised an Aston Martin showroom last week. He undertook the assignment like he was spraying a garden fence. Maybe I'm getting old, cynical and tired but when I see yet another viral video of the disruption, my disapproving-mum voice kicks in, using phrases like appalling and disappointing.

History tell us we need change but I can't help but think a lot of this stuff is done for 'likes', hits and retweets. I'm not convinced that's how we change the world.

Despite numbers being thin on the ground, those present were all united in the belief that meat was damaging the environment and should be wiped off the menu.

This view is both dangerously simplistic and wrong.

Animal Rebellion claim to care about the environment, yet they fail to tell us what would happen to the countryside we know and love if meat were to be banned.

The actions of Animal Rebellion and their associates, as well as recent bans on meat at Cambridge University and Goldsmiths in London, while grossly illogical, present us with an opportunity to defend meat, while contributing positively to the very important subject of climate change and the environment.

If you want to keep your carbon footprint down, buy grass-fed beef and lamb from local British producers. In the UK, we have the climate and the terrain to continue farming this sustainable meat and we owe it to our farmers who work round the clock to comply with the highest ethical environmental standards in the world.

The closer you can source your meat to home, the less mileage it clocks up getting from field to plate.

Which brings me to my main point.

There is another area of meat we collectively aren't doing enough to shout about, despite it ticking all the right environmental boxes and that's game.

Game - whether pheasant, partridge, woodpigeon, venison or rabbit - is a great versatile meat. It is healthy, tastes wonderful and is easy to cook. It's often a lot cheaper, too, meaning it can reach a wide market audience.

The environmental benefits of sourcing game should be welcomed by those that want to do their bit for tackling climate change, all while eating sustainable meat.

Compare bringing a rabbit in from the field to put on the stove, to purchasing an avocado that's been flown hundreds of miles to reach the supermarket. Yes, the avocado is vegan, but at what cost to carbon footprint? The rabbit wins the day.

The long-term benefits to our vast woodlands can also not be overlooked.

Deer, for example, destroy woodland habitat that could act as a carbon soak. We have an abundance of deer and the invasive muntjac that cause significant problems to the low-lying vegetation in woodland that supports ground-nesting birds, such as the now red-listed nightingale.

By managing these venison populations and putting their meat into the market, we are protecting our forests and wildlife, while providing a delicious, lean meal.

Game also provides those meat eaters that are prone to the flexitarian' approach with an exciting avenue to explore. According to the British Game Alliance, which was set up in 2018 to promote the value of feathered game, shot game is becoming more popular among these eaters as it is considered more ethical and contains a third of the fat and twice the protein of a roast chicken.

Admittedly, sourcing game for yourself isn't for everyone. Thankfully, there are many people willing to provide it for you: that is go out, spend money and thus support local economies and then shoot game for you to buy from a game dealer, butcher or restaurant.

There are lots of options out there for sourcing game. The first place should always be your local butcher as are local game shoots and farmers' markets. But if not, Tesco, Sainsbury's and Waitrose all stock a variety of wild game during the season. But you may also find it in Budgens, Lidl and Booths. And if it isn't available, be pro-active and ask your local store to kindly stock it.

At the Countryside Alliance, we have made this easier for you, with an interactive Game Dealer map.

Animal Rebellion and those set on bashing meat would do well to promote game as well as British-farmed livestock if they truly support a sustainable, inclusive, long term, positive future for our environment.

363,Yorkshire Post,Broadsheet,2021,B&K Universal owner defends its work after animal rights protest over alleged dog breeding,"Demonstrators gathered outside B&K Universal’s Grimston facility in the Holderness area calling for an end to the breeding of dogs for medical trials.

Jane Rose, one of those who attended the demonstration, said protesters objected to the “horrific” tests, claiming they were taking place despite evidence questioning their effectiveness.

But a spokesperson for Marshall BioResources (MBR Acres), which owns the Grimston site, said demonstrators’ allegations of breeding at the Grimston site were “untrue”.

They added company dogs bred elsewhere were “critical” to medical trials and that they abide by Home Office regulations.

It comes as protesters, some with Animal Rebellion which organised the demonstration, bore placards with slogans including: ‘End animal Experiments’ and ‘Animals are here with us, not for us’.

The Grimston protest, which lasted around half a day, took place as demonstrators also gathered outside an MBR Acres facility in Cambridgeshire.

Both demonstrations come as the For Life on Earth charity has pushed for an Early Day Motion in Parliament calling for independent hearings on the future of animal testing in the UK.

Comedian Ricky Gervais and actor Peter Egan are among the celebrities which have backed the campaign.

Demonstrations were previously held at the Grimston facility from 2013 to 2015 against plans to expand it.

Company planning applications were refused at their East Riding Council hearing but the decision was later overturned on appeal.

Protester Ms Rose said the testing was “truly awful”.

She said: “Despite the mounting scientific evidence that animal testing does not produce results, the government still allow companies to profit from carrying out horrific tests on animals.

“Beagle puppies are basically poisoned and discarded on a relentless conveyor belt.”

A MBR spokesperson said its staff were trained and tasked with breeding “healthy and content” animals, but they added the facility had been falsely targeted as breeding did not take place there.

The spokesperson said: “The UK is a leader in biomedical research and vaccine development and our work at both MBR Acres and B&K is critical to human and veterinary medical progress.

“We do not carry out research ourselves, but we supply laboratory bred animals to other facilities so that potential medicines can be safety-tested before they are given to volunteers in clinical trials, as required by law.

“As a breeder of research animals, we are regulated and routinely inspected by the Home Office which upholds strict laws around building standards and animal welfare.

“We fully respect that protesters have a right to peacefully protest provided that it is conducted lawfully. Equally, everyone has a right to be able to go to work in a peaceful manner without being harassed.

“Our staff, who are fully trained animal care professionals whose sole task is to raise healthy and content animals, are unfortunately receiving abuse from certain protesters as they come into and leave work to care for our dogs.

“Protesters wanted to duplicate the Cambridgeshire protest at our B&K facility claiming we are breeding dogs there as well. This is untrue.

“We will continue to run our operations in full compliance with Home Office regulations and with our normal high welfare standards.

364,Yorkshire Post,Broadsheet,2022,"Animal Rebellion activists slammed over ‘milk pour’ protests in supermarkets including Harrods, Waitrose & M&S","Animal Rebellion protestors have earned the wrath of the public after pouring milk onto the floor in high-end shops across the country on Saturday (October 15) amid ongoing cost of living crisis that plunged many into poverty in their attempt to create a ‘plant-based future’.

The animal activists coordinated the action in five supermarket locations in London that include Waitrose, Whole Foods, Harrods, and Marks and Spencer along with other stores in Manchester, Norwich and Edinburgh just before 12pm.

The action, which was filmed and has now gone viral on social media, shows several protesters pouring milk from the shelves in the Norwich Marks and Spencer in front of horrified shoppers. Norwich Police confirmed that four people had been arrested for offences of assault and criminal damage.

In Knightbridge, one group of protestors poured milk into Harrods’ food hall, while another was seen pouring milk bottles onto the floor and onto a cheese-laden table in Piccadilly’s Fortnum and Mason. The activists said that they are advocating for a plant-based future and stressing the importance of assisting farmers in transitioning to a sustainable plant-based food system.

‘They should have to pay for it’
One of their videos, which was posted on their Twitter page, has so far received 12.3 million views with many calling out the activists for the ‘massive wastage’ where it could have gone to those in need. Some even said they should ‘pay for it’. One said: “Acting as if there isn’t a cost of living crisis going on and families are struggling to get by whilst they pour milk all over the floor. They should have to pay for it.”

Another said: “I’ve been vegan for eight years now and mortified by this. Waitrose will now have to order yet more dairy milk to replace it. So that’s more harm done. And as a shop worker, I would be one of the people who had to come and clean this up. #NotInMyName.”

A man commented that their action would not get people to support their cause. He said: “While food banks proliferate and people are plunged into poverty, this is the best you can do? You’d get people on your side by donating plant-based meals to people in real need.” One said: “If anything, this sets the vegan cause back years.”

One man however said he understood the drastic action taken by the group. He said: “I think their point is that there’d be far fewer people without food if land wasn’t all being used to provide food and dairy in the western world. The amount of land required for livestock is insane, causing deforestation and starvation.”

‘We don’t have a choice’
In an interview later with LBC, Animal Rebellion spokesperson Robert Gordon said: ""Right wing commentators would have you believe we picked these supermarkets because it’s all we know, because it’s where mummy and daddy took us as kids.

""In reality, we’re just a group of really concerned individuals who have carefully picked these high-end shops because we acknowledge that when we take action. There’s an inevitable level of disruption that will be caused - and we really didn’t want to be disrupting those who are suffering most in the cost of living crisis.

""We picked the Fortnum & Masons, the Selfridges, the M&Ss and we’re sorry for those people who did get caught in that disruption…Frankly, at this point, we don’t have a choice.""

In a statement, another spokesperson for the group, Nathan McGovern said: “We understand that the actions have divided opinion, and fully shoulder the responsbility for them.

","Gordon Ramsay’s three-star Michelin restaurant in London’s Chelsea was occupied by climate crisis activists on Saturday evening who descended to protest at the “perfect inequality” of high-end dining venues. A group of Animal Rebellion supporters entered Restaurant Gordon Ramsay on Royal Hospital Road at around 6pm where they could be seen holding “mock menus” outling the environmental and social cost of the food served in the restaurant.

The mock menus also contained the group’s core demands for a “plant-based future” stylised as a starter, main and dessert. The restaurant serves dinners starting at a price of £155 per person, with dishes including veal and steak which are among the foods with the largest carbon and land-use footprints.

Lucia Alexander, a 39-year-old auxiliary nurse, was involved in the demonstration. In a statement, she called for the UK to transition to a plant-based food system which the group claims is “the answer” to the cost of living and climate crises.

“This restaurant is the perfect example of the inequality we face in the UK right now,” said Ms Alexander. “While Gordon Ramsay serves food costing a minimum of £155 per person, more than two million people are relying on food banks in this cost-of-living crisis.

“Instead of restaurants making colossal profits at the expense of animals, workers, and our climate, we need to feed everyone by supporting farmers and fishing communities in a transition to a plant-based food system. A plant-based food system requires 75% less farmland to grow food, allowing us to feed millions of additional people without the reliance on exploitative and inefficient animal farming industries.”

A statement said: “Unfortunately, extremists, including long-time activists, are committing unlawful and dangerous activities each day against our business and staff.

“On top of this continuous harassment, today this has included breaking into the site and entering our buildings to steal our dogs for a second time this year.

“We are appalled by these actions.

“Dogs bred for research need careful rehabilitation not to be harmed by a sudden change to their environment.

“This unlawful extreme action has placed stress on our animals and staff by totally disrupting our daily activity to take care for the welfare of our dogs on site.”

It said an encampment of activists has been at the site for over 18 months.

“In an advanced democracy we ask why we should tolerate daily harassment and such intimidation endured for such a long time now, when our goal is to produce the best healthy dogs to help research, find and validate new treatments to save human and animal lives,” MBR Acres said.

“This is work required by the medicines regulator in the UK.

“We remain proud of what we do every day because our work allows the progress of medicine to improve – and often save – the lives of humans and animals.”
